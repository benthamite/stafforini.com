I have created a [public Anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1806513892) [[archived](http://www.stafforini.com/anki/David_Burnss_The_Feeling_Good_Handbook.apkg)] including "cognitive distortions", "ten ways to untwist your thinking", and "ways to challenge automatic thoughts", from David Burns's _[The Feeling Good Handbook](http://www.stafforini.com/txt/Burns%20-%20The%20feeling%20good%20handbook.pdf)_. I have also created a Google Form based on Burns's "[Daily Mood Log](http://www.burdenbearersdv.com/documents/Daily_Mood_with_example.pdf)". If you suffer from anxiety, depression or some related mood disorder, this may help.
