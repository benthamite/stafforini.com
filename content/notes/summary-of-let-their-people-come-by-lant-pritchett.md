Introduction – Breaking the gridlock on labor mobility

Rich countries disadvantage poor countries primarily by preventing unskilled labor from moving into their territory. Because unskilled labor is the primary asset of the poor world, it is hard to imagine a policy more directly inimical to poverty reduction. Yet rich countries are toughening up on immigration, and the only pro-immigration moves are those that lower the barriers for the very skilled.

Rich countries should look for ways to increase unskilled labor mobility across their national boundaries, and they should do this primarily because of the enormous expected benefits to migrants. The economics of labor mobility are simple: gains from exchange depend on differences, and in today’s economy the same worker can make enormously higher wages by moving to a different location. But while the economics are simple, the politics are complicated. The challenge is to devise development-friendly labor mobility policies that are politically acceptable to voters in rich countries.

Most analyses about the policies of rich countries assume that policies should be informed exclusively by the interests of the present citizens of those countries. Yet the pursuit of the interests of such citizens could plausibly make poor people worse off. Instead, we should consider which labor mobility policies would be most beneficial to the world’s poor while still being politically acceptable for citizens in rich countries.

The industrial world currently transfers about USD 70 billion a year in overseas development assistance. Charitably, assume that such transfers result in USD 70 billion in benefits for poor-country citizens. By contrast, a mere three percent rise in the labor force of rich countries through relaxing of restrictions would result in USD 300 billion in benefits to those poor people. And far from being costly, this measure would result in USD 51 billion in benefits for rich countries.  Yet incredibly, just five industrial countries spend USD 17 billion in preventing these labor flows that would benefit rich and poor alike.

Strikingly, advocacy from the “development community” has largely ignored labor mobility, instead focusing almost exclusively on improving financial flows or reducing trade barriers. Political considerations cannot explain this neglect, since parallel considerations apply to free trade, which is much more frequently advocated.

The structure of the book is as follows.  First, it discusses five *irresistible forces* creating growing pressures for the greater mobility of labor. Second, it discusses eight *immovable ideas* held by rich-country citizens that hold those forces in check. Finally, it proposes six *accommodations*, or elements of rich-country policy toward unskilled labor mobility that might break the policy deadlock and reconcile the irresistible forces and immovable ideas while still producing policies that are development friendly.

### Five irresistible forces

*Gaps in unskilled wages*. Wage gaps of between 2 to 1 and 4 to 1 between immigrant-sending and immigrant-receiving countries sufficed to cause massive migration flows in the 19th century. And at present, the real wage gaps are often as high as 10 to 1.

*Differing demographic futures*. Rich countries differ starkly from poor countries in the age composition of their respective populations. A fundamental principle of economics is that these differences create trade, so these increasing differences will create ever greater pressures for labor flows.

*The globalization of everything but labor*. Increases in labor mobility have been small compared with the greatly increased flows of goods, and capital.  Further liberalization of goods or capital will exhibit diminishing returns, whereas huge benefits can be realized by lowering barriers to labor.

*The rise of employment in "low-skill, hard-core nontradables*.*"*  Much of the incremental growth in the labor force will be in "hard-core nontradables", or services that cannot be outsourced and that do not require high skill levels.

*Lagging growth in "ghost" countries*.  Large negative and positive changes in the economic prospects of specific geographic regions will create pressures for migration.

### Eight immovable ideas

The proximate barrier to the movement of people across national boundaries is *coercion*. But the coercive apparatus is under the control of the democratic process. Hence the ultimate barrier to increased labor mobility are the ideas of the citizens that participate in this process. Eight ideas underpin resistance to increased labor flows:

*Nationality is a morally legitimate basis for discrimination*. Although limiting people's life chances due to circumstances such as sex, race or ethnicity are widely regarded as morally illegitimate, the single largest factor affecting a person's life chances is the country in which they happen to be born.

*There is a moral perfectionism based on proximity*. The second idea is that proximity or physical presence in the same political jurisdiction is a key determinant of moral obligation: as long as a Haitian is suffering while physically in Haiti, Americans have no or very modest obligations, but as soon as that person manages to arrive on American soil, the corresponding obligations grow enormously.

*"Development" is exclusively about nation-states, not nationals*. The third idea is that the goal of development is restricted to the fate of those who remain within the borders of their nation-state. The international system and all its agencies are almost exclusively concerned with what happens within national boundaries, rather than with the individuals that could in principle move across borders.

*Labor movements are unnecessary to raise living standards*. The fourth idea is that movement of people is unnecessary because either trade in goods or movements of capital can by themselves lead to the equalization of wages.

*Increased migration of unskilled labor will lower wages or take jobs, and worsen the distribution of income in the receiving countries.*The fifth idea is that increased flows of unskilled labor will be bad for the unskilled labor already in the country.  Unlike most other ideas, this idea is almost certainly true. But, first, it would be inconsistent to oppose immigration while defending free trade, which also has bad effects, and secondly, any serious proposal for increased immigration must include ways to address these effects.

*Movers are a fiscal cost because they use more services than they pay in taxes*. The sixth idea is that newly arriving immigrants will constitute a fiscal burden by using more public services than they pay for in taxes.  But []

*Allowing movement across borders creates risks of crime and terrorism*. The seventh idea is that immigration increases the risk of terrorist attacks. No proposal that fails to take into account these security concerns will ever be politically viable.

*"They" are not like "us"*. The final and perhaps the main idea underlying opposition to increase immigration is that the physical presence of others who espouse different value systems will undermine the cultural cohesion of the existing society.

### Six accommodations for politically acceptable, development-friendly migration

A politically acceptable and development-friendly scheme for labor mobility should include six features:

*Bilateral, not general multilateral, agreements*. There is little prospect for binding multilateral commitments; most host countries will engage in agreements that include only selected nationalities.

*Temporary status for labor mobility*. The best hope for increased admission of unskilled labor is labor mobility through temporary agreements.

*Rationing, using specific quotas*. Only carefully controlled allocations that use deliberative mechanisms to address fears are likely to succeed.

*Enhance the development impact on the sending country*. Development-motivated labor mobility policies should include ways of enhancing the perceived development impact.

*Involvement of the sending country in enforcement*. To address the concern that liberal democracies are incapable of adequately enforcing agreements unilaterally, the cooperation of sending countries should be secured if possible.

*Protection of the fundamental human rights of migrants*. To be politically acceptable in rich countries, programs need to emphasize that people coming to perform unskilled labor are not making "tragic choices" from economic desperation but are making positive choices in which their dignity and rights are maintained.

## Chapter one - Four irresistible forces for increased labor mobility

### Irresistible force one: large and increasing wage gaps across countries

#### Divergence and income gaps across countries

While in 1820 only about 10 percent of the differences in world income was due to differences in average incomes across countries, such differences explain 60% of the inequality that exist today.  A poor peasant in nineteenth century England was not much better off than his or her Ethiopian counterpart, whereas poor people in rich countries are now better off that even most rich people in poor countries.

#### Gaps in wages

Though it is difficult to make real wage comparisons, it appears that the wage differentials that set in motion the mass migrations in the late nineteenth century were substantially smaller than the current gaps in real wages between potential migration partners. The wage ratios between, say, Japan and Vietnam (9.1 to 1), the UK and Kenya (7.2 to 1), or the US and Guatemala (6.1 to 1) are substantially larger today than past historical ratios, such as US and Ireland or US and Sweden (2.3 to 1 and 4.1 to 1, respectively).

#### What do migrants earn when they move?

Wage differences create pressures for labor mobility to the extent that they reflect differences in earnings potential for the same individual. The existing literature suggests that nearly all the differences in wages between individuals in rich and poor countries are explained by the *location* of the worker, not their personal characteristics. When workers move, their earnings look much more like the earnings of workers in the country the move to than the earnings of workers in the country where they moved from.

#### Gaps as a force for migration

The wage gaps between similar workers in different countries constitute a clear force impelling greater labor mobility across national boundaries.  Such gaps are currently at historically high levels.  There are two main caveats to this use of wage gaps as an index of migration tendencies, though.  First, the *pressure* for labor movements and the *propensity* to move need not coincide: the latter depends on the worker's ability to actually undertake a long-distance move. Much of the empirical literature examining actual movements within and across countries is consistent with the hypothesis that the propensity to migrate at first *rises* with rising income: as income increase from very low levels, more people are able to respond to the pressure for movement. Second, although wage differentials can motivate people to move, not all migration need be economically motivated. Some migrants relocate not with the goal of settling in the new country but as a way of accumulating a stock of savings. Increases in wage differentials might have complex effects on the flow and stock of migrants.

### Irresistible force two: differing demographic futures

Current UN population projections indicate that the labor force of many European countries and of Japan will not just cease to grow but will decline in absolute terms and by substantial amounts. By contrast, the neighbors of Europe and Japan will have fertility rates well above replacement levels.

These differing demographic futures have two major implications. First, the relative populations of certain regions will shift massively. Second, the changes in the labor-force age population will change even more dramatically. It is unclear how financially viable the current pension and social transfer schemes will be under such conditions.  Migration is not necessarily the solution to this and other problems arising from an aging population.  To keep support ratios at their current levels, the fraction of foreign-born labor force will need to be about 50% by 2050 for Japan, Italy and Germany. It is hard to believe that these societies would allow anything like such levels of labor mobility.

#### Irresistible force three: "everything but labor" globalization

### Irresistible force four: continued employment growth in productivity-resistant, low-skill, hard-core nontradable services
