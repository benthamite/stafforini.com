An up-to-date list of all apps currently installed on my Android phone can be found [here](http://www.appbrain.com/user/pablo.stafforini/galaxy-nexus).  Please note that you need an [AppBrain](http://www.appbrain.com/) account to see the list (the service is free, and you can easily create a new account by linking it to your Google or Facebook profile).

As I no longer use AppBrain, this post is now out of date. See [this post](http://www.stafforini.com/blog/android-apps-i-like-2/) for my current list of Android apps.
