I have created an Anki deck with definitions for each of the terms and expressions included in the glossary of David Chalmers's recent book, _Constructing the World_.  The deck may be found [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3916604735) [[archived](http://www.stafforini.com/anki/David_Chalmers_-_Constructing_the_World.apkg)].
