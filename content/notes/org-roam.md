Org-roam is a plain-text personal knowledge management system for Emacs, built on top of org-mode.

## Features

- **Backlinks**: Automatic bidirectional linking between notes.
- **Graph visualization**: Explore the structure of your notes visually.
- **Fast note capture**: Quick creation of new notes with templates.
- **SQLite database**: Efficient indexing and querying of the note graph.

## Design philosophy

Org-roam is inspired by Roam Research and implements the Zettelkasten method in Emacs. Each note is a single org-mode file with a unique identifier.
