A while ago, I did a quick survey of the literature on earning to give---the pursuit of a high-earning career with the express purpose of donating a large portion of one's earnings to high-impact charities. Given the recent interest in the topic, I thought I should turn those notes into a proper bibliography. If I'm missing anything, please let me know.

If your profoundest interest is dying children in Africa or Bangladesh, it's probably best to go to Africa or Bangladesh, not to Wall Street.

Working to fund one's philanthropic ventures is certainly noble. But we shouldn't downplay the value of the income-generating work just because we can't see as directly how it helps others.

When we look at the consequences of our actions, and consider whether to take a job in a harmful industry, the harm of our taking the job is somewhat less than it first appears. There is still a harm, though, so you shouldn't take the job unless you think you can do something pretty good with it.

You need to pay attention to what other EAs are doing. But it doesn't mean that we should always avoid working in harmful industries, or thinking in general about how to individually make the most difference.

We recommend earning to give only because we look at the way the world is and we reckon it makes a positive difference. If the world became different, and lots of people naturally decided to do earning to give, we'd recommend something else.

Suppose you're looking to donate as much as possible to charity, and are choosing between two jobs. Should you worry about the taxes in each location?

Even in your spare time, which you usually can't turn into money to donate by working additional hours, you should still not engage in local charitable activities.

Earning to give involves four main ideas: (1) donate; (2) donate to the most effective organizations; (3) earn more so you can give more; (4) spend less so you can give more.

Examples of people in clearly beneficial jobs like Boris Yakubchik (high school math teacher) and Julia Wise (social worker at a prison) are both much less controversial and much more attainable for the typical reader.

Kaufman, Jeff. [Earning to give](http://www.jefftk.com/p/earning-to-give-transcript), Effective Altruism Global, August 6th, 2016.

Earning to give is a career path that is well suited to people who are good at earning money, who are still exploring cause areas, who prioritize interventions that are funding-limited, who are early in their careers and want to build their skills, or who want to balance altruism against other things in their lives. I find that it suits me well, but I also can imagine myself doing something else five years from now.

Kuhn, Ben. [Downgrading confidence in earning to give](http://www.benkuhn.net/downgrading-confidence-earning-give), Ben Kuhn's blog, April 5th, 2013.

Concludes that (1) doing high-paying highly-skilled careers might be dominated by doing directly charitable things and that (2) effective altruists should probably be spreading a broader message.

Altruistic bankers earn a lot, aren't likely to be replaceable, and can support the very best charities. They are likely to do more good than someone in an "ethical" career.

Earning to give is often the best career option because of (1) discrepancy in earnings, (2) replaceability and (3) high variations in charity cost-effectiveness.

MacAskill, William. [Replaceability, career choice, and making a difference](https://www.academia.edu/1557895/Replaceability_Career_Choice_and_Making_a_Difference), _Ethical theory and moral practice_, vol. 17, no. 2 (April, 2014), pp 269-283.

Defends the idea that deliberately pursuing a lucrative career in order to donate a large proportion of one's earnings is typically ethically preferable to a career within the charity sector.

MacAskill, William. [80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should earn to give long term](https://80000hours.org/2015/07/80000-hours-thinks-that-only-a-small-proportion-of-people-should-earn-to-give-long-term/). 80,000 Hours blog, July 6th, 2015.

80,000 Hours never claimed that most people should earn to give; and now thinks that even fewer people should pursue this path to impact than it did before.

When considering whether to do direct work or earn to give, you could ask yourself: am I in the top 15% of people in terms of comparative advantage at earning to give?

It would be a mistake to think of the returns to entrepreneurship as predictably stemming from just showing up and taking a spin at the wheel of startup roulette. Instead, entrepreneurship is more like poker: a game where even the best players cannot predictably win over a single night, but measurable differences predict that some will earn much more than others on average.

Shulman, Carl. [Software engineering: Britain vs Silicon Valley](http://80000hours.org/blog/26-software-engineering-britain-vs-silicon-valley), 80,000 Hours blog, February 21st, 2012.

How attractive is the software industry for those who want to make money and use it to do good? In some ways, the British statistics are misleading, but they also reflect a real difference: software engineers in the US, and especially Silicon Valley, really are better compensated. The post lays out the supporting data, and discusses ways people outside the United States can make their way to Silicon Valley.

Altruists have stronger reasons to pursue risky careers because the standard arguments for risk aversion do not apply.

Todd, Ben. [Show me the harm](http://80000hours.org/blog/239-show-me-the-harm), 80,000 Hours blog, July 31st, 2013.

Makes some very rough estimates of how harmful finance would have to be in order for its harm to outweigh the good realized by the donations of someone who earns to give.

Earning to give in finance is slightly better than medical research.
