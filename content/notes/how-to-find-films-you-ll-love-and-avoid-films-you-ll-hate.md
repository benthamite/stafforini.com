Experimentation. This is a meta-rule. The question you should ask yourself when deciding whether to watch a movie shouldn't be: "Do I really want to spend two hours of my time watching this?" Rather, the question should be: "Does this movie seem good enough to justify my watching it for at least a few minutes, in order to gain enough knowledge to decide whether I should watch it for longer?" In general, I think it would be remarkable if, for every movie that we could potentially watch, we should either watch that movie in full or not watch it at all. (This rule obviously generalizes to many other classes of decisions.)
