I have created Anki decks for [Chrome](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/119714158) [[archived](http://www.stafforini.com/anki/Chrome_Windows_keyboard_shortcuts.apkg)] and [Vimium](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1615416392) [[archived](http://www.stafforini.com/anki/Vimium_keyboard_shortcuts.apkg)] keyboard shortcuts.  They have been added to my list of [Anki decks by LessWrong users](http://www.stafforini.com/blog/anki-decks-by-lesswrong-users/).

Edit: I have now created an Anki deck for Asana [[archived](http://www.stafforini.com/anki/Asana.apkg)] keyboard shortcuts.
