Examples:

*Exercising*. General health benefits, rather than antidepressant.

*Acts of kindness*. Utilons rather than fuzzies. E.g. being a good son.

*Talking*. Describing the world rather than connecting with others (e.g. talking about personal stuff)

*Giving money to beggars*. Ineffective from an EA perspective, but might be an effective way to reduce risks of violence when confronted by aggressive beggars (or to purchase fuzzies—YMMV).

*Dancing*. When dancing level is bad, instead of getting frustrated, switch to a different function: bond with people, or seduce them.

*Dancing*. Although I enjoyed classes more than milongas, I stopped attending classes because I thought I was good enough.

*Meals*. Thinking I should refuse a dinner invitation just because I already had dinner, although I could clearly enjoy spending an evening with this person. Same for breakfast, lunch.

*Transportation*. We usually assume the function of transportation is to get from A to B. So we neglect the value of long layovers (exploring Madrid on my way to Buenos Aires, or Moscow on my way to Tokyo) or longer routes (e.g. Oxford-Brighton trips as an opportunity to dance in London; or scenic walks over shorter walks).

*Temporary accommodation*. I have often opted in favor of Airbnb over hostels because the former yield a better comfort-to-price ratio. But the latter are much better for socializing.

*Value of information*. Dave and testosterone patches: he frames the choice as either using the patches forever or not at all. This seems to result from conceiving the intervention as having direct value, rather than informational value. [This is a particularly interesting case, because we have an independent tendency to overlook the value of information. So it's *especially* easy to neglect the informational value of doing the same activity for a short period of time.]

*Value of motivation*. A key reason for achieving a goal is to increase one's ability to achieve further goals. This means (1) one should avoid making excuses, and (2) one should initially pick goals that are easy to achieve. Elster on bunching, Winter on success spirals.

*Wearing orange-tinted glasses*. I found that I could look at myself in the mirror with much less discomfort.

*Cold showers*. Function is not body hygiene, but sleep improvement.

*Wearing gloves.*Not to directly protect against infection but to remind myself that the hand had been in contact with potentially infected surfaces.
