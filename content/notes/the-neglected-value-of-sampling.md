I think what causes people to neglect the value of sampling is a kind of functional fixedness. We tend to think that the function of watching a movie, say, is to be entertained or have an aesthetic experience. As a result, we fail to appreciate that sometimes watching a movie can have an additional function: to give us knowledge about whether a movie is worth watching in the first place. (Another way of expressing this idea is by relying on the distinction between exploitation and exploration. I'm claiming that, when an activity is perceived as a form of exploitation, it is harder to appreciate that it may sometimes also be a form of exploration.)

Applications:

The other day I was deliberating whether I should attend a certain party. I didn't know who else might be attending, so I was very uncertain about the enjoyment I would derive from attending this event. There was a decent chance that the party would be awesome, and also a decent chance that it would be horrible. I spent 15 minutes trying to determine what the mean value was, and in the end I decided to stay at home. In retrospect, this strikes me as an obvious mistake: instead, I should have attended the party, stay there for a short while, and on the basis of that experience decide whether I should stay longer or go back home. The costs of attending a bad party for half an hour clearly justified the potential benefits of attending an awesome party for several hours.

Heuristics for identifying areas where sampling should be used more often:
