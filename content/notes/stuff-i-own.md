_Omnia mea mecum porto._ - Cicero

_Update 1_ (2018): I am [profiled](http://www.stafforini.com/blog/2171-2/) in Rowan Hooper's book, _Superhuman_.

_Update 2_ (2022): Both my bliefs and my circumstances have changed significantly since writing this post, and I no longer endorse some of the things I say below. The list of possessions at the end is now hopelessly out of date. Also, minimalism is more common now than it was back in 2014, so I don't expect this to be as interesting as it may have been when it was first published.

All the stuff I own fits in a carry on backpack.

It wasn't always like this.  I used to spend countless hours per week at second-hand bookstores. My [personal library](https://www.librarything.com/profile/Benthamite) had over 3,000 books. During the year I spent as a graduate student at the University of Toronto, I bought so many books that, when the time came for me to leave the country, I had to have them shipped to Oxford in a cargo container. The whole operation cost me more than a thousand dollars, and much stress and anxiety. In retrospect, it seems clear that owning all this stuff was a major liability, but at the time I was like the character in Bertrand Russell's _Autobiography_ who, when asked whether he would destroy the world if he had the power to do so, replied: "What? Destroy my library? --- _Never!_"

My attitude to stuff began to change when I read Paul Graham's [essay on stuff](http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html). Since then, I have become increasingly aware of the virtues of minimalism.  And now that I'm a digital nomad, I have developed an aversion to the very idea of standing in a relation of ownership to parts of the physical world.

There are people out there who advocate minimalism for ideological or philosophical reasons, such as anti-capitalism or asceticism.  For me, however, living with less stuff is all about [having more fun](http://youtu.be/oTugjssqOT0?t=12m8s).

When my friends learn I own so little, they become curious. They want to know which things I have eschewed, and which I can't do without. The list below is an exhaustive inventory of all my worldly possessions.
