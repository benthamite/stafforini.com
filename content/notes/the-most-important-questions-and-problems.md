What are the most important questions to answer? What are the most important problems to solve? Various people and organizations in the effective altruist community have over the years compiled lists of such questions and problems. This post provides links and brief descriptions of all the lists I'm currently aware of. (Note that many of these lists focus on specific causes, such as artificial intelligence, or on specific disciplines, such as moral philosophy.)

*Update: This post was originally written in 2017. Michael Aird has more recently compiled a very comprehensive [list of open research questions](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MsNpJBzv5YhdfNHc9/a-central-directory-for-open-research-questions), which largely supersedes the present list (though Aird's directory excludes some entries included here).*

*Further update: 80,000 hours has now released an impressive [list of research questions that could have a big social impact, organised by discipline](https://80000hours.org/articles/research-questions-by-discipline/)*.

## [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/)
