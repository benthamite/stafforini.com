To [encourage others to give](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-01-15/to-inspire-people-to-give-be-public) and to keep myself accountable, I've decided to start a log of my charitable donations. This report covers donations made during the period 2013-2016, and will be updated at the end of each new year. I may also start tracking money moved in addition to direct donations, [as Peter does](http://peterhurford.com/other/donations.html), and might provide information about donations made prior to 2013, if I find the relevant records.

Note that the amounts I donate are very modest relative to those donated by some of the effective altruists I most admire, such as [Brian](http://reducing-suffering.org/my-donations-past-and-present/), [Peter](http://peterhurford.com/other/donations.html), [Jeff](http://www.jefftk.com/donations), and [Michael](http://mdickens.me/donations/). At some point in the past, I considered [earning to give](http://www.stafforini.com/blog/writings-on-earning-to-give-an-annotated-bibliography/), but ultimately decided that I could have a much bigger impact through direct work, in particular by multiplying the impact of other, highly impactful EAs. I estimate that my current impact through direct work, counterfactually adjusted, is maybe 100 times my impact through donations (the EA I work for, who moves hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to cost-effective charities and has considerable direct impact through public advocacy and outreach, believes that I make him ~⅓ more impactful and that I'm largely irreplaceable).

## Detailed breakdown {#detailed-breakdown}

_Note: many of the donations to the Centre for Effective Altruism---my employer between May 2013 and June 2014, and July 2016 until June 2018---were in the form of unclaimed expenses._
