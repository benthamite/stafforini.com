> If we believe that the best ways of shaping the far future are relatively broad, it becomes important to find out what kinds of causes have the most signicant ripple effects of the right kind. It may be important to identify causes that have a high ratio of far future benefits to proximate benefits, since these causes are likely to be much more important than they are by ordinary standards. In some cases, we know that our actions have relatively limited ripple effects on the far future, and this can lead to surprising moral conclusions. For instance, I believe that preventing animal suffering in factory farms has very little ripple effects on the far future. By ordinary standards though---at least by ordinary non-speciesist standards---reducing suffering in factory farms would be extremely important. But because I accept the future-shaping argument and I believe reducing suffering on factory farms does very little to shape the far future, I now consider reducing suffering on factory farms to be much less important than I did previously. Or, more precisely, I now consider reducing suffering on factory farms to be much less important in comparison with other things than I did previously.
