Years ago I wrote a [blog post](http://www.stafforini.com/blog/effective-altruism-syllabi/) listing all the university courses on effective altruism I was able find. I have since tried to keep the list updated, as I stumble upon new courses or people draw my attention to them. As a number of courses have recently been offered specifically on [longtermism](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/longtermism) and related topics, I figured that instead of adding them to the original list, I could create a new one with this more restricted focus.

If you think I'm missing anything, as always, please let me know.
