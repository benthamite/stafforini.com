I've created two new Anki decks.  The [first one](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1053501313) [[archived](http://www.stafforini.com/anki/German_cases.apkg)] lists German case inflections for all gender, number and article combinations.  The [second one](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/58419656) [[archived](http://www.stafforini.com/anki/Notes_of_the_chromatic_scale.apkg)] contains recordings of each of the 12 notes of the chromatic scale, in various octaves, played on the piano and as a pure sine wave; it is an experimental deck to test whether spaced repetition could help develop perfect pitch.

My other Anki decks may be found [here](http://www.stafforini.com/blog/category/anki/).
