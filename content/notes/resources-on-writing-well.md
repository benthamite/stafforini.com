This list of resources revises and expands a document that my friend Aron Vallinder created a while ago.  The hyperlinks go to the corresponding Amazon.com pages.  The average Amazon customer review score appears in brackets, followed by the total number of reviews.  If the book is available in electronic format for free, a separate link is provided. A few items are also accompanied by brief annotations.  If you think I'm missing some good resource, please let me know.
