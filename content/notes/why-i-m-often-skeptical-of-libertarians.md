Libertarians tell us that we should favor free markets and free trade, because there are various arguments concluding that they increase human welfare. But these arguments assume that certain conditions are met; when these conditions aren't met, the arguments no longer work. So you should expect these libertarians, if they are honest, to be concerned with whether those conditions are met when they present their arguments, and to either insist that those conditions should be met when they aren't, or to campaign for non-market ways of allocating goods when they cannot be met.

In practice, this is not what we generally observe. Libertarians tend to oppose *government regulation* and ignore *market failures*, without concerning themselves with whether the regulations in question weaken or strengthen markets, or with whether the domain in question is suitable for market mechanisms in the first place. In behaving in this way, these libertarians behave more like ideologues for big business than like individuals concerned with general welfare.
