What follows is a Spanish translation of my favorite essay of all time: Paul Graham's [Keep your identity small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html). I'm not very pleased with the way in which I translated the title, but I wasn't able to come up with any better alternatives; the verb 'to keep' (in the relevant sense) and the second person (in the imperative mode) are both singularly hard to translate into Spanish.
