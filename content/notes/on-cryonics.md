As evidenced by the extent and degree to which people find it "weird" or "silly", cryonics seems to be one of those things that are deeply opposed by system 1. Thus, the only way to come to have a positive view about cryonics is via system 2.  But for this reason, it doesn't end up supported by the visceral impulse of self-interest. Because cryonics can only in principle appeal to rationalists (a tiny demographic), but rationalists are rarely rational egoists, and cryonics is much easier to justify on egoistic grounds (if at all), we end up with the result that cryonics is supported by extremely few people.

However, this is not the whole story. There is also the "trivial inconvenience" and the financial cost. Muehlhauser considers a thought experiment in which cryonics is free and open to anyone filling a simple Google Form.  Although Luke himself claims that he would still not sign up under such conditions, it seems clear to me that many people that currently don't subscribe would.

Even if one ultimately rejects cryonics, considering the question is useful as a tool for detecting inconsistencies in my beliefs. This requires that one's arguments against cryonics are one's "true rejection", rather than reasons that may persuade others but do not explain why one oneself rejects it.  For example, if I reject cryonics because of considerations about personal identity, why do I take actions that appear to be justified by virtue of prolonging my life? Why do I take supplements or eat veggies? A temptation here is to try to rationalize these actions by finding other possible justifications for them. But are these really the reasons we originally decided to do these actions? If not, isn't it surprising that actions that we first performed for a reason we now regard as invalid turn out to be justified by other reasons? So we see this pattern:

A. I do x because of y. ["

B. If I were to do x, it would be because of y. But I believe -y. So I'm not doing x. ["If I were to sign up for cryonics, it would be because life-extension is good. But I don't believe that life extension is good. So I'm not signing up for cryonics."]

[[I reject x because the point of x is y, and z shows that there is no point in y. ["I reject cryonics because the point of cryonics is to extend life, but personal identity shows that there is point in life-extension."]]]

Application of B to things one doesn't do (cryonics) often leads to the identification of non-justificatory explanations (life extension) that seem to also explain why one does other things (diet, exercise). This leads to the application of A to these things, to determine whether these apparent explanations really explain why one does such things. We then sometimes discover that we do these things for other reasons. But at other times we discover that we do in fact do these things for those same reasons. Here it is tempting to find alternative justifications for these things. This creates a _mismatch between explanation and justification_, which in turn motivates a debunking explanation of those justifications. Isn't it surprising that one does something for reasons which, upon reflection, one realizes are invalid, yet these same activities happen to be justified for _other /reasons? This in turn may lead to the identification of /an explanation of this coincidence_ that would make it less surprising. However, the debunking argument may be applied at this higher level, too, if we find ourselves explaining coincidences more often than we would antecedently expect. (example: vegetarianism)

At this stage, one may become skeptical of the whole approach, and wonder whether looking at the merits of the arguments isn't a better strategy after all. How one answers this questions will depend on one's views about the general reliability of merits-based arguments.  If such an approach lacks a good-track record, then it would make more sense to look for debunking arguments

This model shows the importance of thinking about both "true rejections" and "true acceptances".  By thinking about the former, we identify considerations bearing.
