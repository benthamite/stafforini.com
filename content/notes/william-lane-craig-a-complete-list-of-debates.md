William Lane Craig is, far and away, my favorite debater, and over the years I've watched, listened to, and read dozens of his debates with atheists, agnostics, Muslims and liberal Christians. There are several sites that provide lists of debates with Craig, but none of these lists are exhaustive, and some of them are inaccurate (providing e.g. erroneous dates). So I've decided to remedy this situation by creating my own list. As far as I can tell, the list is complete, but if you notice any omissions, please [let me know](http://www.stafforini.com/?page_id=181).

Some of my friends may be surprised to learn of my interest in this Christian apologist, and might even suspect that I have become a Christian myself. Let me, then, make it clear that, while I admire Craig's _debating skills_, I reject many of his _substantive views (/some of which I find [[<http://commonsenseatheism.com>_?p=682][monstrous]])./ _I see no tension in holding these two attitudes: public debates are not conducive to the discovery of truth, and skill at debating should not, therefore, be regarded as indicative of correctness of belief.  As Luke Muehlhauser [[<http://commonsenseatheism.com>_?p=1437][notes]], "The reason Craig wins all his debates with atheists is not because his arguments are sound, but because he is a masterful debater." (I do, however, believe that debates can offer more than mere entertainment, and exposing myself to Craig's debates has helped me clarify my thinking in various ways.)

The table below currently lists over a hundred debates. My favorites are those with Douglas Jesseph, Arif Ahmed, Shelly Kagan, Quentin Smith, Ray Bradley, and others I'm forgetting.
