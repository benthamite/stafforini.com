I finally realized with my latest productivity system (Trello + Pomello) works so well. It's because it decouples the management of inputs from the management of outputs. In other words, it decouples time-management from task-management.

Kanban boards are great for managing tasks; pomodoro timers are great for managing time. My productivity system is great because it integrates the two into a single workflow. Trello + Pomello is powerful both for identifying what needs to get done and for actually doing it (cf. the distinction between standards of rightness and a decision procedures).
