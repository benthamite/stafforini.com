Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that holds that the best action is the one that maximizes overall well-being or utility.

## Classical utilitarianism

The theory was developed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Bentham's formulation focused on the "greatest happiness principle": actions are right insofar as they promote happiness, and wrong insofar as they produce the reverse of happiness.

## Varieties

Several variants of utilitarianism have been developed:

- **Act utilitarianism**: Judges each individual action by its consequences.
- **Rule utilitarianism**: Judges actions by whether they conform to rules that would maximize utility if generally followed.
- **Preference utilitarianism**: Maximizes the satisfaction of preferences rather than happiness per se.

## Influence

Utilitarianism has been enormously influential in moral philosophy, economics, public policy, and the [effective altruism](/notes/effective-altruism/) movement.
