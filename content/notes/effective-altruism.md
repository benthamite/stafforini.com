Effective altruism is a philosophical and social movement that advocates using evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.

## Core ideas

The movement is built on several key principles:

- **Cause prioritization**: Some causes offer far greater opportunities for impact than others.
- **Evidence-based giving**: Charitable donations should be directed based on rigorous evidence of effectiveness.
- **Career choice**: One's career can be a powerful tool for doing good.

## History

The intellectual roots of effective altruism can be traced to utilitarian philosophers, particularly Peter Singer's 1972 essay "Famine, Affluence, and Morality."

The term "effective altruism" was coined around 2011, when several organizations and individuals began to coalesce around these ideas.

## Organizations

Key organizations in the effective altruism ecosystem include:

- GiveWell
- 80,000 Hours
- Open Philanthropy
- The Centre for Effective Altruism

## Criticisms

Critics have raised several objections to effective altruism, including concerns about its utilitarian framing, its focus on quantifiable outcomes, and the concentration of resources in a small number of cause areas.
