Over the years, I've had many conversations about personality psychology with various friends. In some of those exchanges, these friends expressed curiosity about my own personality (as I did about theirs). Accordingly, I decided to post here the results of a [Big Five personality test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) I took some time ago, so that I can refer folks to this post whenever the topic comes up in future conversations.

**Openness**: 88% (88th percentile)

**Conscientiousness**: 15% (0.2nd percentile)

**Extraversion**: 38% (11th percentile)

**Agreeableness**: 55% (28th percentile)

**Neuroticism**: 70% (95th percentile)

If I had unlimited powers of self-modification, I would make myself much more conscientious and much less neurotic, and somewhat more agreeable and extroverted.
