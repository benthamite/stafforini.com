## Lesson 1: understanding style {#lesson-1-understanding-style}

The book rests on two principles: it is good to write clearly, and anyone can.

Unclear writing has many causes, but the chief reason most of us write unclearly is that we ignore that we do, and why we do it.

Most experienced writers get something down on paper or up on the screen as fast as they can. Then as they rewrite that first draft into something clearer, they understand their ideas better. And when they understand their ideas better, they express them more clearly, and so on. Use the material in this book not _as_ rules to impose on sentences as you write them, but as principles to help you identify already written sentences likely to give your readers a problem, and then to revise those sentences quickly.


## Lesson 2: correctness {#lesson-2-correctness}

We may distinguish three kinds of rules. _Real rules_ define what makes English English: for example, the rule that articles must precede nouns. _Social rules_ distinguish standard from nonstandard English. _He doesn't have any money_ is standard English. _He don't have no money_ is nonstandard English. Invented rules are rules that some grammarians believe writers should observe, but are neither real nor social. There are two types of invented rules: _folklore_ and _elegant options_. Folklore rules --such as the rule that one shouldn't begin sentences with and or _but_--are pseudo-rules, and are routinely violated by careful writers. Elegant option complement real rules: such rules, when observed, make writing seem slightly more self-consciously formal. Examples include: 'Don't split infinitives', 'Don't end a sentence with a proposition', 'Use the singular with _none_ and _any_', and many more.


## Lesson 3: actions {#lesson-3-actions}

There are two main principles of clarity:

1.  Make important actions verbs
2.  Make main characters subjects

This lesson discusses the first principle; the second principle is discussed in the next section.

Consider this sentence:

Our lack of data prevented evaluation of UN actions in targeting funds to areas most in need of assistance.

The sentence violates the first principle: the actions are not verbs but abstract nouns. To conform to the principles, the sentence above may be rewritten as follows:

Because we lacked data, we could not evaluate whether the UN had targeted funds to areas that most needed assistance.

No element of style more characterizes turgid writing than lots of nominalizations--abstract nouns derived from verbs or adjectives--, especially if they occur as subjects of verbs. Nominalizations usually end in _-tion_, _-ment_,/-ence/ and _-ing_, so be on the look for them.

You can quickly spot and revise five common patterns of nominalizations.

1.  The nominalization is the subject of an empty verb such as _be_, _seems_, _has_, etc.:

The intention of the committee is to audit the records.
The committee intends to audit the records.

1.  The nominalization follows an empty verb:

The agency conducted an investigation into the matter.
The agency investigated the matter.

1.  One nominalization is the subject of an empty verb and a second nominalization follows an empty verb:

Our loss sales was a result of their expansion of outlets.
We lost sales because they expanded outlets.

1.  A nominalization follows _there is_ or _there are_:

There is no need for our further study of this problem.
We need not study this problem further.

1.  Two or three nominalizations in a row are joined by prepositions:

We did a review of the evolution of the brain.
We reviewed how the brain evolved.

Some nominalizations are useful, however. Don't revise nominalizations in these cases:

1.  When they refer to a previous sentence:
2.  When they replace an awkward _The fact that_:
3.  When they name what would be the object of a verb:
4.  When they name a concept so familiar to your readers that it is a virtual character:


## Lesson 4: characters {#lesson-4-characters}

Consider this sentence:

The fear of the CIA was that a recommendation from the president to Congress would be for a reduction in its budget.

The sentence violates the second principle of clarity. Readers want characters as their subjects. So make the subjects of most of your verbs short, specific, and concrete--the main characters in your story. To do this, follow this procedure:

1.  Skim the first seven or eight words.
2.  Find the main characters.
3.  Skim the passage for actions involving those characters, particularly actions buried in nominalizations.
4.  Reassemble the new subjects and verbs into a sentence, using conjunctions such as _if_, _although_, _because_, _then_, _how_, and _why_.

Sometimes you must write about abstractions. When you do, turn them into virtual characters by making them the subjects of verbs that tell a story. If readers are familiar with your abstractions, no problem. But when they are not, avoid using lots of other abstract nominalizations around them.

For some critics, the passive voice should be avoided as much as possible because it deletes the agent. But sometimes the passive is the better choice. In particular, use the passive in these contexts:

-   You don't know who did an action, readers don't care, or you don't want them to know.

-   You want to shift a long and complex bundle of information to the end of its sentence, especially when it also lets you move to its beginning a chunk of information that is shorter, more familiar, and therefore easier to understand.
-   You want to focus your readers' attention on one or another character.

Some writers and editors avoid the first person by using the passive everywhere. However, the first-person _I_ and _we_ are common in scholarly prose when used in the context of metadiscourse (_I claim that..._, etc.).


## Lesson 5: cohesion and coherence {#lesson-5-cohesion-and-coherence}

Sentences are _cohesive_ when the last few words of one set up information that appears in the first few words of the next.

Some astonishing questions about the nature of the universe have been raised by scientists studying _black holes in space._ _A black whole_ is created by the collapse of a dead star into a point perhaps no larger than a marble.

To make your sentences more cohesive, follow these two principles:

1.  Begin sentences with information familiar to your readers.
2.  End sentences with information that readers cannot anticipate.

Sentences are _coherent_ when they use subjects to name their topics.

_Readers_ understand what a passage is generally about when _they_ see consistent ideas toward the beginnings of sentences, especially in their subjects. _They_ feel a passage is coherent when _they_ read a sequence of topics that focuses on a narrow set of related ideas. But when _topics_ seem to shift randomly, _readers_ lose the context of each sentence. When _that_ happens, _they_ feel they are reading paragraphs that are unfocused and even disorganized.

To make your sentences more coherent, follow these two principles:

1.  In most of your sentences, use subjects to name their topics.
2.  Put those subjects close to the beginning of the sentence.

These principles should be qualified in two respects. First, to avoid monotony, do not use the same words for the same topics in exactly the same positions. Secondly, to avoid faking cohesion, do not overuse connecting devices, but instead rely more on the logical flow of the ideas.


## Lesson 6: emphasis {#lesson-6-emphasis}

There are two kinds of complexity: _grammar_ and _meaning_.

To deal with complex grammar, begin sentences simply, then add complexity.

A sociometric and actuarial analysis of Social Security revenues and disbursements for the last six decades to determine changes in projecting deficits is the subject of this study.
In this study, we analyze Social Security's revenues and disbursements for the last six decades, using sociometric and actuarial criteria to determine changes in projecting deficits.

To deal with complex meaning, (1) state information explicitly and (2) move technical terms from the beginning to the end of sentences.
