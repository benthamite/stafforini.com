Inspired perhaps by Luke's [movie recommendations](http://lukeprog.com/FavoriteMovies.html), I have decided to pick my favorite films of the 2000s.  More specifically, I'm picking one film --my favorite-- for each of the ten years comprising that decade.  Future posts will list my favorite films for other decades.  I may revise this post as I watch new films, or as my tastes change.

I should note that I barely watched any films during the second part of the decade. This may explain why my picks for the last five years of this period are more mainstream, and arguably lower in quality.
