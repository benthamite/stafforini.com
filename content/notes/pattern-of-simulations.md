I just read Elga's excellent paper, which clarified a few things.  I was thinking about our discussion about whether the "pattern" of simulated realities should make a difference to the credence you attach to the hypothesis that you are simulated, and it now seems to me that I can at least articulate an argument to why it should indeed make such a difference.  Compare two scenarios.

*The Horizontal Simulation.* John starts a simulation and populates it with 99 simulated beings ("sims").  Each sim is in an evidential state indistinguishable from John's.  Each takes himself to have created 99 sims, but without actually having done so.

*The Vertical Simulation*. John starts a simulation, but populates it with just one sim.  This first sim starts a second-order simulation inside the first-order simulation, and populates it with a second sim.  This second sim starts a third-order simulation inside the second-order simulation, and populates it with a third sim.  And so on until a 99-th order simulation is populated with the 99th sim.  Each sim is in an evidential state indistinguishable from John’s.  Each takes himself to have started a simulation leading to the same hierarchy of simulations, containing the same number of sims.  (So the sims’ beliefs become increasingly less veridical as they become more and more removed from reality: the first sim has true beliefs about all but the last sim; the last sim has no true beliefs at all.)

I would argue that both scenarios pose the same *self-location* skeptical question, but the second poses, in addition, a standard skeptical question.  According to Elga's principle, John should attach the same subjective probability to his being any of the 99 sims as he attaches to being the person running the simulation.  This holds true for both the horizontal and the vertical simulations.  For the question of self-location, it doesn't matter how many levels removed from him a sim is, provided that his states are subjectively indistinguishable.  On the vertical simulation, however, the "pattern" of the simulation seems to give John a reason to think that the series doesn't terminate with himself, the person at the bottom, but in fact continues down the line.  Perhaps he should think, in light of the pattern he observes, that the person 99 levels removed from the 99th sim is not living in the real world, but is himself a sim, and that there are many levels below him.  This is not a self-location hypothesis, but a standard skeptical hypothesis, since the question is not only about which member in the series is himself, but also about how many members there are in the series.
