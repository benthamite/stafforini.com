It never ceases to amaze me how often event organizers fail to insure that presentations are properly recorded and made available online. This seems to be a specific instance of a more general type of failure, where the relevant parties abstain from taking the necessary measures to insure that a valuable exchange of information is known to a wider audience than that present at the interaction (see Brian's "Why I prefer public conversations", http://reducing-suffering.blogspot.de/2012/07/why-i-prefer-public-conversations.html). But what makes the specific failure described above particularly puzzling is that (1) organizing a an event, esp. a conference, takes a lot of time and money, whereas recording and uploading a talk takes very little; and that (2) usually way more people will watch an online recording than attend the original talk. So you would expect that EAs, who stress the importance of cost-benefit analysis, would be aware of this and act accordingly. This seems not to be the case, however. Consider Spencer Greenberg's talk at the Effective Altruism Summit. This talk appears to have been good and stimulating enough to prompt Jess Whittlestone to write a blog post on the value of entrepreneurship (http://80000hours.org/blog/256-should-more-altruists-consider-entrepreneurship). Yet this talk is nowhere to be found on the web. Nor is Luke Muehlhauser presentation at Quixey, on such an important topic as "Effective altruism and the end of the world" (http://intelligence.org/2013/08/16/luke-at-quixey-on-tuesday-aug-20th/).

I mention this not to blame specific individuals, but to remind EAs in charge of organizing an event
