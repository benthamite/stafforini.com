Standard view: you should believe what follows from sound arguments.
"Bayesian" approach: arguments are just another piece of evidence. In Bayesian terms:
P(some proposition|my finding an argument for that proposition sound). To assess this probability, I need to assess the corresponding likelihood ratio, and here all sorts of considerations that the Standard View would regard as irrelevant or even "fallacious" become absolutely relevant. For instance, the intelligence or intentions of the person proposing the argument. A smart person can produce a seemingly sound argument for whatever proposition she wishes to defend, regardless of whether the proposition is true or false. So if I know that the argument is being advanced by a very smart person, I should conclude that I'd find their argument plausible anyway. Thus, the likelihood ratio is ~unity, and the argument provides no additional evidence in favor of the proposition relative to my prior.
