## Features

- Requires no cooking and little preparation
- Extremely nutritious and satiating
- Cruelty free vegan
- Ranks well on a wide range of diets (low-fat, low-carb, raw, low methionine, etc)
- Is comprised entirely of non-processed ingredients, whose nutritional benefits are backed by solid evidence
- Is flexible enough to be followed

## Implementation

In my experience, the best way to implement this diet is to *delegate the whole process to someone else*. When I was living in Argentina, I hired a person who came to my place once per week for about four hours. She would buy all the ingredients and prepare the salads for the entire week. All I had to do was to mix the chunky and leafy veggies (which last much longer if kept separately) and add the dressing.
