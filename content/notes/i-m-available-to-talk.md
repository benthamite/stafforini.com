I've recently reached the conclusion that having more one-to-one interactions with effective altruists will likely increase my positive impact. So if you are an EA (broadly defined) and would like to have a conversation with me, please do get in touch.  Originally I posted a similar announcement to the [EA self-help Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=600419023315408), and the focus was on helping people with personal issues. But I'm equally happy to discuss EA ideas and related subjects.

Contact me with a couple of suggested time slots between 3pm and 11pm ([GMT](http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/)) on any day (including weekends), and I will either confirm one of those slots or suggest a few alternatives.  We can use Hangouts, Skype, WhatsApp or Signal. I will assume that the conversation will last about 30 minutes; if you would like to talk for longer, that's fine, but please let me know in advance so I can plan accordingly.
