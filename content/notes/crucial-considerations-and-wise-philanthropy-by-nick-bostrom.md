On July 9th, 2014, Nick Bostrom gave a talk on 'Crucial Considerations and Wise Philanthropy'  ([audio](https://soundcloud.com/gooddoneright/nick-bostrom-crucial-considerations-and-wise-philanthropy)|[slides](https://nickbostrom.com/lectures/crucial.pptx)) at [Good Done Right](https://www.stafforini.com/blog/good-done-right/), a conference on effective altruism held at All Souls College, Oxford.  I found the talk so valuable that I decided to transcribe it.

With Leo's revised version. We are waiting for the BAE site to go live so that I can load the images directly from that server instead of having to upload them to Wordpress.
