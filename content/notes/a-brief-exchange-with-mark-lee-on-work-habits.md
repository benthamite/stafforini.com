Recently I sent Mark Lee, a friend of mine and an admirably dedicated effective altruist, the following email:

> Hey Mark,
>
> I hope you are well. I wanted to ask you a quick question about your working habits. Over the past three or four months, I have gradually reduced all my non-EA activities, to the point that dancing tango is the only thing I do other than working for CEA. However, this hobby still takes a lot of my time. Furthermore, at times dancing sucks me in to such a degree that I begin to lose interest in making the world a better place altogether. For these reasons, I am now considering dropping this and concentrating solely on EA. Since you once told me that you could work the entire day spending no time on recreation other than watching an occasional movie at the end of the day, I was wondering if you had any tips worth sharing for someone interested in emulating what you do. Do you follow any conscious strategies to stay motivated? Have you ever experienced burnout? And how atypical do you think you are in this respect, relative to other effective altruists and utilitarians?

He replied:

> the aim is to align what you want to want to do, and what you want to do; it is easy (no strain on willpower) to do what you want to do all the time. easier said than done, and i certainly don't achieve this all the time, but that's the aim.

> more specifically, things that might help:
>
> -   goal-factoring on tango. figure out what you are getting out of tango (e.g. clear sense of improving excellently at something which increases self-perception of power; community and romantic experiences; physical pleasure from the movements; just to guess at a few) and how to get those in other ways that are either (i) EA or (ii) not EA but time-efficient. i could totally imagine tango being an efficient way of getting this package of benefits, in which case it might be a good thing for you to do; the worry, as you say, is if you'll only want to do tango.
> -   supportive EA live-work environment - makes it so that if you value being valued by your peers, or engaging with friends in certain ways (e.g. enjoyable mutual striving), the way to do that is not very different from doing EA
> -   having a bit of virtue ethics (intrinsically or instrumental to consequentialist ends), e.g. working really hard and a lot, to make the world a better place, and persisting through willpower difficulties or other discomforts, is benevolent, noble, strong, etc.
> -   making work fun - for me, working in pairs or small groups over a tasty meal &gt; typing on my laptop alone in my room
>
> i haven't experienced burnout. i've experienced periods of demotivation but not as a result of working too much (instead typically as a result of thinking i and the things i'm doing suck). i don't think i'm atypical in this regard
>
> take care, pablo :)

I am quoting this exchange because I suspect many other effective altruists have faced, or currently face, similar dilemmas in their own personal lives. If you have thought about this issue or would just like to share your own experience, please do chime in. :-)
