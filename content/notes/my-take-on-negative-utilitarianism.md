Two views: NU and NLU
Arguments (some support NU, some support NLU, and some support both):


## Argument 1 {#argument-1}

states should be evaluated from the inside, not relative to some external standard. But when we focus on states not involving pain (including pleasures of different intensities), we find that there is "nothing problematic" about them.


## The arbitrariness argument {#the-arbitrariness-argument}

There is no objective matching between different pleasure/pain intensities. So CU is false.

First, this is at best an argument against CU, not an argument for NU, since the falsity of CU doesn't imply the truth of CU.

Second, this is at best an argument against CU combined with a realist metaethics. A subjectivist can perfectly consistently endorse CU while acknowledging that the trade ratios are subjective.

Third, what are the reasons for concluding that there is no objective matching? This claim is often asserted, but rarely argued for. Insofar as the claim is plausible, it derives its plausibility from the fact that we cannot identify what _precise_ intensity of pleasure a given intensity of pain would correspond to.  But this difficulty can be explained as resulting from our having limited capacities of discrimination. Moreover, most of us _can_ make _imprecise_ pleasure-pain comparisons: few would deny that the pain of being tortured is more intense than the pleasure of being caressed (indeed, it seems we can claim that the former is _many times_ more intense than the latter, suggesting that pleasure and pain can be measured along a common ratio scale). [However, there's evidence that people can match the intensity of stimuli in two very different domains.  Intuitively, it seems implausible that there is an objective matching here. So the fact that we can match intensities in the case of pleasure and pain provides little if any evidence for my view.] Moreover, I think we have a explanation of why people think there is no such objective matching. These people are anti-realists and so inadvertently slide from the claim that the _value_ of the relevant properties are dependent on our attitudes to the claim that these properties themselves are somehow subjective.  But of course this inference is unwarranted.

Fourth, it seems that whatever considerations suggest that there is no objective fact of the matter concerning pleasure and pain intensities would also suggest that there is no objective fact of the matter concerning pains of different intensities. [I'm not sure if this reply is sound.


## The motivation argument {#the-motivation-argument}

it's logically possible for an agent to be in a pleasurable state and lack a desire to have a more pleasurable state, but it is logically impossible for an agent to be in a painful state and lack a desire to be in a less painful state.


## The asymmetry between making happy lives and making people less miserable {#the-asymmetry-between-making-happy-lives-and-making-people-less-miserable}

The argument involves a comparison between two cases that differ in two relevant ways, not just one. First, the cases differ in the experiences involved: one involved pain, whereas the other involves pleasure. But second, the cases differ in what happens with those experiences: in one case, a new person is being created, whereas not in the other case.

The argument would work if the asymmetry in our intuitions could be traced back to the first difference.  But the argument would fail if the asymmetry was instead explained by differences of the second sort.

Yet it is clear that the asymmetry is explained by the second sort of difference. Moreover, we know that the intuition that is driving our intuitions is itself false.

At this point, some NUs invoke an auxiliary hypothesis about the metaphysics of personal identity.

Experience moments are the relevant normative units. So everything is population ethics. Therefore, the asymmetry applies to all cases.

This argument confirms the suspicion that the NUs are relying on population ethical intuitions to support their case, rather than on experiential intuitions. But this is a strange way of arguing.

Moreover, the intuition of neutrality which this argument appeals to is demonstrably false.

Effectively, by combining the intuition of neutrality with a Parfitian metaphysics, they have extended the error that is at the core of this intuition to all of ethics.


## Other arguments {#other-arguments}

Preference-frustration argument. Urgency argument. The argument that pleasure is just the absence of pain.
