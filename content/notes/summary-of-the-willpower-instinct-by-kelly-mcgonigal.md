This summary of _The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do To Get More of It_, by Kelly McGonigal, draws heavily on the section [] at the end of each chapter. In addition to including a concise statement of the chapter's main idea, the section includes two subsections that summarize two different kinds of assigments included in each chapter: 'Under the microscope' and 'Willpower experiments'. The former prompts the reader to pay attention to how a specific idea is impacting his or her life. The latter are practical strategies for improving self-control based on a scientific study or theory.


## Chapter one -- I will, I won't, I want: what willpower is, and why it matters {#chapter-one-i-will-i-wont-i-want-what-willpower-is-and-why-it-matters}

Willpower consists of three distinct powers--I will, I won't, and I want--that helps us to be a better version of ourselves.


### Under the microscope {#under-the-microscope}

-   _What is the harder thing?_ Imagine yourself facing your willpower challenge, and doing the harder thing. What makes it hard?
-   Meet your two minds. For your willpower challenge, describe your two competing selves. What does the impulsive version of you want? What does the wiser version of you want?


### Willpower experiments {#willpower-experiments}

-   _Track your willpower choices_. For at least one day, try to notice every decision you make related to your willpower challenge.
-   _Five-minute brain-training meditation_. Focus on your breath using the words 'inhale' and 'exhale' in your mind. When your mind wanders, notice, and bring it back to the breath.

Trying to suppress thoughts, emotions, and craving backfires, and makes you more likely to think, feel or do the thing you most want to avoid.


### Under the microscope {#under-the-microscope-8}

-   _Investigate ironic rebound_. Is there something you try to avoid thinking about? Does suppression work, or does trying to push something out of your mind make it come back stronger?
-   _What's on your Most-Wanted list?_ In your experience, is it true that outlawing something increases desire for it?


### Willpower experiments {#willpower-experiments-8}

-   _Feel what you feel, but don't believe everything you think_.  When an upsetting thought comets to mind, notice it and how it feels in your body. Then turn your attention to your breathing, and imagine the thought dissolving or passing by.
-   _Accept those cravings--just don't act on them_.  When a craving hits, notice it and don't try to immediately distract yourself or argue with it. Remind yourself of the white-bear rebound effect, and remember your goal to resist.
-   _Surf the urge_. When an urge takes hold, stay with the physical sensations and ride them like a wave, neither pushing them away nor acting on them.


## Chapter ten -- Final thoughts {#chapter-ten-final-thoughts}

-   We are both the self hat wants immediate gratification and the self with a higher purpose.  Self-control is a matter of understanding these different parts of ourselves, rather than fundamentally changing who we are. / People who have the greatest self-control aren't waging self-war. They have learned to accept and integrate these competing selves./
-   If there is a secret for greater self-control, it is _the power of paying attention_: training the mind to recognize when you are making a choice, rather than running on autopilot.
