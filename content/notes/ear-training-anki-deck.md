I have created an Anki deck with sound samples of around 40 of the most widely used chords, in root position.  (This deck is unlikely to be of interest to non-musicians.)  The deck may be found [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1935085027) [[archived](http://www.stafforini.com/anki/Ear_training_chords.apkg)].

I may add more chords, or chord inversions, in the coming months.
