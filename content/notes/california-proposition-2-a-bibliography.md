This bibliography was prepared for a research project on California Proposition 2 that I undertook a while ago, while volunteering for [Effective Animal Activism](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/). As I became increasingly busy with many other activities, the project was eventually put on hold. I hope to resume work at some point in the future; in the meantime, I thought I should at least make this material public, in the hope that it might inspire others to do research in this and related areas.
