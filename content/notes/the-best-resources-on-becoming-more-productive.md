Of all the resources on productivity that I'm familiar with, these are the ones I've found most useful.  If you think I'm missing something, please let me know.

The resources are listed in rough descending order of usefulness. I recommend going through these resources one at a time, starting from the first one, and proceeding to the next one only after you have succeeded in implementing at least the most valuable bits of advice.
