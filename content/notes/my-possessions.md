## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Write post on my possessions {#write-post-on-my-possessions}

MacBook Pro 16 inch, 2021
I use my laptop and average of eight hours/day, and my two previous laptops have each lasted five years and were sold for one fourth of their purchase price. That boils down to a cost of 30 cents per hour of use, which seems too low for me. Unfortunately, this is already the most most expensive MacBook money can buy: 16 inch display, 64 GB RAM, 8 TB SSD.

### [Minaal Carry-on 3.0 bag](https://www.minaal.com/products/carry-on-bag-3) {#minaal-carry-on-3-dot-0-bag}

With a 35L capacity, this is the larger of my two backpacks. It weighs 1.41kg, which is less than most backpacks of comparable size, but still more than I would like. (An underappreciated fact is that the backpack is often the heaviest item in a person’s luggage.) I like its design, both functionally and aesthetically, and overall I’m pretty satisfied with it. My main two reservations are its (for me) redundant laptop compartment and that it does not not stand upright by itself.

I use this backpack only when moving to a new city. I wear it on my back, while wearing the Daily as a “front pack”.


### [Minaal Daily 3.0 bag](https://www.minaal.com/products/daily-3-0-bag) {#minaal-daily-3-dot-0-bag}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/3A394AE3-6F93-45C3-A8D6-C654598BC569-1.png" >}}

This is a 21L backpack, otherwise very similar to the Minaal Carry-On. I use it on a daily basis, typically to carry my laptop and keyboard when going to cafe or a coworking space and to carry my clothes when going to the gym.


### [Minaal Packing Cubes 3.0](https://www.minaal.com/products/packing-cubes-3-0) {#minaal-packing-cubes-3-dot-0}

These packing cubes help me organize my possessions by grouping related objects together. I use the big packing cube to put my clothes, and the smaller ones to put electronics: computer-related ones (hubs, cables, chargers) in one, and bathroom-related ones (shaver, water flosser, toothbrush and nose hair trimmer) in the other.

The main thing I dislike about them is that they are not black.


### 16-inch Macbook Pro 2021 (maxed out) {#16-inch-macbook-pro-2021--maxed-out}

Most people can be classified reasonably well along a frugality continuum, but no me. I own very few items, but I’m also happy to spend a lot of money on some items that I believe are really worth it. When my previous laptop broke, I decided to buy the best Macbook money could buy. My reasoning was that, historically (and with surprising consistency), I replaced laptops only once every five years. Since I use my laptop an estimated eight hours per day, its cost per hour is very low even for the most expensive models. By spending around 40 cents per hour of expected use, I got a machine with an M1 Max chip, 64 GB of memory, and 8 TB of storage. (I bought this laptop in early 2022; back then, the M2 chip did not exist and 96 GB of memory was not offered.)

My main uncertainty here is whether I should continue using macOS or whether I should switch to Linux. I don’t think I use any proprietary software, and I spent most of my time on Emacs. Given this, and my strong preference for tinkering with my computing environment, it does seems like Linux would be a more natural operating system for me. I haven’t done so out of a concern with the transition costs and a fear that some of the critical applications I use on macOS (such as [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)) won’t be available or won’t have equivalents in Linux.
