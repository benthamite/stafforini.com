A while ago, my friend [Aron Vallinder](http://www.vallinder.com) and I decided to write a paper on wild animal suffering. At some point in the process, we thought it might be useful to contact experts on animal pain and poll them about their subjective estimates that various types of animals can suffer. We came up with a list of about 15 academics, whom we then proceeded to contact. Some of these folks were kind enough to suggest other researchers, who in turn made further suggestions, in a process that culminated with a our current list of 35 individuals. We were unable to find working email addresses for 10 of these people. ([spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AokMPIEI5Mb8dG1PaEpzaUlNZ3pWcDczLWkzeVduQUE&usp=sharing))
