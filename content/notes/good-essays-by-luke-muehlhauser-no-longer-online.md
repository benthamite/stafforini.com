When Luke Muehlhauser updated his [website](http://www.lukeprog.org) at the end of 2011, many of his essays ceased to be available. I tried to persuade him to put them back online, but I didn't succeed. Fortunately, the Internet Archive keeps cached versions of the old site, and the essays can still be accessed there. Here are links to the ones I found most useful:

- [Conquer Rejection by Not Eating the Moon](http://web.archive.org/web/20080102131847/http://www.lukeprog.com/selfhelp/eating_the_moon.html)
- [How to Speed Read](http://web.archive.org/web/20080102131858/http://www.lukeprog.com/selfhelp/speed_reading.html)
- [The Art of Plain Talk](http://web.archive.org/web/20080102131923/http://www.lukeprog.com/writing/art_of_plain_talk.html)
- [How to Write for the Web](http://web.archive.org/web/20080102131937/http://www.lukeprog.com/writing/how_to_write_for_the_web.html)

The old site also featured a section on [Self-help Guru Ratings](http://web.archive.org/web/20110820085531/http://lukeprog.com/selfhelp/guru_ratings.html). Years ago, I recommended this list to a friend of mine, with the following comment:
> I actually clicked on every single review to see which authors were rated positively (only Cudney, Dunnan, and Gilbaugh were, I believe). Maybe he errs on the side of harshness, but at least this criterion makes you quite confident that if a book managed to please him it probably has something good to offer. Elsewhere on his site, he also praises John T. Reed's book *Succeeding*.

**Update**: Peter Hurford [points out](https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/534201626636199/?comment_id=534254733297555&offset=0&total_comments=9) that "The Art of Plain Talk" was [reposted](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=15963) to Common Sense Atheism.
