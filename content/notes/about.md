This is not really a blog, or at least not a prototypical one. Rather, it is a repository of miscellaneous stuff, comprising [bibliographies](http://www.stafforini.com/blog/?cat=6), [book summaries](http://www.stafforini.com/blog/category/books/), [Anki decks](http://www.stafforini.com/blog/category/anki/), and more. Since this material seemed to be of potential interest to at least a few other people, I thought I should make it available online, so here it is.
