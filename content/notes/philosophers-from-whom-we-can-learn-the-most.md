Many questions of high utilitarian significance fall squarely within the scope of philosophy. Such important areas of philosophical research include ethics, epistemology and philosophy of mind. Yet professional philosophy is a diseased discipline. First, professional philosophers very often work on trivial questions (e.g., “how is knowledge best analyzed?”). Secondly, when they do address questions of importance, they are seldom motivated by a concern to find the truth, and answers are instead assessed on poor criteria, such as originality, elegance, “cleverness”, and tendency to vindicate cherished beliefs. Fortunately, there are a few philosophers addressing many of the relevant questions, and from whose work we can learn a great deal. What follows is a list of such philosophers, in alphabetical order. Links go to their respective PhilPaper profiles or (when no profile exists) to a list of their works available at that website. The topics or areas to which the philosopher has made important contributions indicated in parentheses. (See also Will Crouch's blog post on high-impact philosophy.)
