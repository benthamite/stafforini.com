According to my records, I finished about 70 books in 2014. For a period of three months, I averaged about three books per week, while there were months when I hardly read any books at all. My choice of material was severely constrained by availability: I consume books only when engaged in tasks--such as cleaning, walking and exercising--that involve physical movement, so I can only choose titles available as audiobooks. For this reason, I wasn't able to follow the general advice, which I regard as very solid, of prioritizing textbooks over other forms of non-fiction.  Even accounting for this constraint, however, I am not that happy about the books I ended up reading, and I believe I could have relied upon better selection criteria.  Upon reflection, it seems that the following three rules

1. Truth over history
2. Importance
3. Marginal returns.
4. Recency.
