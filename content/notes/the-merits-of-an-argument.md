One may think that this is because of the status hit that one would suffer as a result of openly acknowledging one's imperfect ability to assess arguments. However, I don't think this is a good diagnosis.

In addition to the ability of the person assessing the argument, one also should consider the ability of the person making the argument.

So signaling concerns don't seem to play a big role here. Instead, I think that people rarely say those things /because they have internalized a norm according to which one should only assess arguments "on their merits", and abstain from invoking considerations that are only statistically relevant. /This norm seems to draw a clear distinction between the grounds that ultimately explain why a proposition is true and the grounds that a person invoke for believing that proposition; only the former grounds are admissible.
