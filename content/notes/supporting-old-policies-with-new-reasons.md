As my thinking evolves, I find myself concluding that my reasons for doing various things have little to do with the reasons that originally prompted me to do those things.

Examples from my own life:

Veganism

Examples from other people:

GiveWell on poverty
Shulman made related remarks about Yudkowsky
Cowen on redistribution: "To cite some pluses from redistribution, a welfare state can give the poor greater access to education and nutrition. These individuals not only enjoy a higher quality of life, but they produce goods and services, they contribute to tax revenues, and they are less likely to end up as a destructive social force.45 Other growth-enhancing benefits of redistribution are political in nature. Welfare payments sometimes “buy” the loyalties of special interest groups, thereby inducing them to support public order. Some of the poor will be less desperate and will feel less desperate as well. Those groups receive a financial stake in the system and socially sanctioned legitimacy for their claims. More generally, welfare systems make many higher-income individuals feel good about their state and increase levels of political support. Many people want to have states whose benevolence they can feel good about. This benevolence contributes to state legitimacy and thus to public order." (p. 32)

We may try to resist the force of the debunking argument by identifying a consideration on which coincidence is expected rather than surprising.
