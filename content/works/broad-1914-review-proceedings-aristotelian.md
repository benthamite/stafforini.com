This review discusses the 13th volume of the new series of *Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society*. It covers papers on the nature of cause, the philosophy of Bergson, the nature of volition, the meaning of the implicit and the obscure in mental states, and the nature of probability. In particular, it highlights the paper by Mr. Russell on the notion of cause, who argues that causation is best understood in terms of functional correlation rather than the traditional notions of cause and effect. The review also considers Dr. Wolf's paper on probability, which argues that the meaning of probability depends on the nature of the world, whether deterministic, indeterministic, or a mixture of both. Finally, the review discusses the symposium on the implicit and the obscure in mental states, arguing that while there are strong arguments for the existence of implicit elements in consciousness, they are not conclusive. – AI-generated abstract.
