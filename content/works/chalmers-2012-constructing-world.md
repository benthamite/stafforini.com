David J. Chalmers constructs a highly ambitious and original picture of the world, from a few basic elements. He returns to Rudolf Carnap's attempt to do the same, and adopts the idea of scrutability-according to which reasoning from a limited class of basic truths yields all truths about the world-to address central themes in philosophy.
