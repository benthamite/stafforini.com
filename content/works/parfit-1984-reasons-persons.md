Reasons and Persons challenges, with several powerful arguments, some of our deepest beliefs about rationality, morality, and personal identity. The author claims that we have a false view of our own nature; that it is often rational to act against our own best interests; that most of us have moral views that are directly self-defeating; that we often act wrongly, even though there will be no one with any serious ground for a complaint; and that, when we consider future generations, it is very hard to avoid conclusions which most of us will find disturbing. The author concludes that non-religious moral philosophy is a young subject, with a promising but unpredictable future.
