The law of "eat or be eaten" is probably ultimately evil and therefore God probably does not exist. If God existed, he would not have created carnivores but instead have created only 2710 vegetarian animals; instead of tigers, he would have created vegetarian tiger-counterparts. The attempts of Swinburne, Hick, Schlesinger, Reichenbach and Plantinga to defuse the problem of natural evil are considered and rejected.
