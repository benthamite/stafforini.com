This article discusses and evaluates the morality of benign carnivorism; a practice where animals reared for human consumption are treated humanely and killed painlessly. The author considers different justifications for benign carnivorism, such as that it can satisfy the interest of humans in eating meat, the well-being of the animals being raised, and other impersonal reasons. However, the author argues that the interests of the animals, particularly their interest in continuing to live, generally outweigh the interests of humans in eating them, making the practice morally unjustifiable. The author also examines the possibility of modifying animals genetically so that they naturally die in good health at a certain age, suggesting that such a practice might be permissible but also raises concerns about equality and sustainability. – AI-generated abstract.
