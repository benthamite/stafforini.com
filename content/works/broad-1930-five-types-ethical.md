This book surveys five different historical ethical theories: those of Spinoza, Butler, Hume, Kant, and Sidgwick. The author's goal is not simply to summarize their views but to provide a philosophical analysis of their arguments and their relative strengths and weaknesses.  The analysis is broken down by topic and then across the five philosophers. Each author is assessed for their respective views on the nature of man, how this nature determines what we desire and how we act, what the definitions and relationships are between notions such as good, bad, right, wrong, and ought, and how these concepts are related to our emotional experiences. The analysis concludes with an examination of the relative roles of reason, sentiment, and emotion in our experience and how far it is possible to reduce ethics to a coherent and consistent system.  – AI-generated abstract.
