Richard Nisbett’s intelligence and how to get it ad- vances several interlocking claims: (1) the heritability of IQ is far lower than typically claimed by behavioral geneticists, (2) the IQ differences across social classes are largely environmental in ori- gin, (3) the IQ differences across racial groups are entirely environ- mental in origin, and (4) these group differences can be narrowed substantially by interventions that social scientists have already discovered. In this review I show that Nisbett’s arguments are con- sistently overstated or unsound.
