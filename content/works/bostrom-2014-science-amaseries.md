This post discusses a hypothetical scenario wherein a bear would imagine a superbear based on its understanding of bears. The author posits that we humans might be engaging in a similar exercise when attempting to understand superintelligences due to the large gap between our cognitive abilities and theirs. They suggest that we might be unable to conceive of the true capabilities and properties of superintelligences, just like a bear cannot conceive of an animal far more intelligent than itself. The author concludes that we should be cautious about our assumptions about superintelligences and remain open to the possibility that our current understanding is incomplete and limited – AI-generated abstract.
