Robert F. Kennedy's memoir of the Cuban missile crisis provides a first-hand account of the events from the perspective of the Attorney General and a key member of the President's inner circle. The book focuses on the deliberations of the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (Ex Comm), which advised President Kennedy on how to respond to the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. The memoir chronicles the tense negotiations between the US and the Soviet Union, highlighting the potential for miscalculation and escalation leading to nuclear war. Kennedy emphasizes the critical role of the President's calm demeanor, his willingness to consult with a wide range of advisors, and his careful consideration of the Soviet Union's position in shaping the US's response. He ultimately argues for a measured approach, emphasizing the importance of diplomacy and avoiding direct military confrontation. – AI-generated abstract
