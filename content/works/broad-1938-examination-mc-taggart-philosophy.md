This work is a meticulous examination of the two-volume work *The Nature of Existence* by John McTaggart Ellis McTaggart, a renowned philosopher of the early 20th century. McTaggart's philosophy is a complex system that attempts to construct a metaphysics founded on the principles of endless divisibility and determining correspondence. The author begins by outlining McTaggart's psychological and epistemological foundations, including his analysis of cogitation, prehension, sense perception, volition, and emotion. He then delves into McTaggart's arguments against the reality of space, time, and matter, and proposes counterarguments. McTaggart's mentalism, which holds that all particulars are spiritual and none are material, is carefully examined and compared to the mentalism of Leibniz. The author concludes by exploring McTaggart's theory of value in the universe, arguing that, despite its internal inconsistencies, McTaggart's system offers a unique and intriguing approach to the fundamental questions of metaphysics. – AI-generated abstract.
