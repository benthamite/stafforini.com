"Strangers Drowning" by Larissa MacFarquhar explores the lives of individuals who dedicate themselves to helping others, offering intimate portraits of their unwavering integrity, compromises, bravery, and the complex dilemmas they face. Through compelling stories of couples adopting numerous children in distress, founding leprosy colonies in India, and individuals prioritizing charity over personal needs, MacFarquhar examines the moral complexities of selflessness and the societal skepticism it often evokes. By weaving historical perspectives on do-gooders, the book challenges readers to confront fundamental questions about human responsibility, the limits of compassion, and the balance between personal well-being and the needs of strangers in a world of immense suffering.
