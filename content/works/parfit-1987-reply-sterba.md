The writer responds to an article by David Boonin-Vail in this issue. Boonin-Vail, he explains, maintains that by solving an alternative paradox he deprives the writer's own Mere Addition Paradox of its moral force. He argues that his Mere Addition Paradox does retain its moral force because Boonin-Vail offers no support for the premise that would deprive it of such force.
