In this article I address the issue of trade and global justice. I argue that the best way to enhance opportunity for the poor in the world is to establish conditions of global free movement of goods, services, and persons. Moellendorf deserves credit for having addressed the question of international trade, and even more credit for having criticized protectionist policies as inconsistent with global justice. Yet establishing free trade is, I believe, much more urgent than creating the global redistributive agency that Moellendorf favours, and it might well render that agency unnecessary. These comments are intended, then, as a friendly amendment to Moellendorf's views.
