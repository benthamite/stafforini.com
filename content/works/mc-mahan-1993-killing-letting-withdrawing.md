This article discusses two distinctions within common morality: that between killing and letting die and the implicit wider distinction between doing and allowing. The definitions and existence of these distinctions are explored, and a proposal is made for how to distinguish between killing and letting die in cases involving withdrawing aid or protection. This proposal holds that withdrawing aid or protection counts as killing if the aid or protection was operative, complete, and self-sustaining, while withdrawing aid or protection counts as letting die if the aid or protection was in progress and required further contributions from the agent for it to be effective. This proposal is complicated somewhat by the fact that there are numerous factors that may affect the moral status of a course of conduct that has lethal consequences, in addition to the distinction between killing and letting die. – AI-generated abstract.
