This dissertation proposes and defends a hedonistic view of human subjectivity, agency, and value, distinct from utilitarian ethics and the idea that only pleasure is desired. It argues that pleasure, understood as immediate, self-sufficient experience valued for its own sake, is the ultimate source of value in human life. The work criticizes preference satisfaction accounts of pleasure and welfare, outlines a hedonistic conception of pleasure, and addresses objections raised by philosophers like Plato, Moore, and Anscombe. Drawing on contemporary work in philosophy, psychology, and psychobiology, the dissertation develops a specific hedonistic view that emphasizes the central role of pleasure in shaping action, attention, and consciousness. This view suggests that the dimension of subjectivity where human value resides is fundamentally similar in humans and other higher vertebrates.
