Consequentialists defend the view that the rightness of an action is determined by its consequences. However, they fail to explain why rightness and wrongness are not matters of degree. This article aims to demonstrate how an account of scalar morality could justify consequentialism. The author distinguishes between scalar and all-or-nothing theories of rightness and wrongness. By taking the former approach, one can argue that morality is concerned with goodness and badness, rather than rightness and wrongness, enabling a more coherent consequentialist position. Therefore, wrongness does not entail blameworthiness, and rightness does not entail having a moral obligation. Instead, morality provides a scale of reasons for action, with better actions having stronger reasons associated with them. – AI-generated abstract
