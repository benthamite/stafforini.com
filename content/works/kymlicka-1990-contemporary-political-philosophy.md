This book provides a critical introduction to the rapidly growing literature on theories of justice and community. Each chapter covers a major school of contemporary political thought - utilitarianism, liberal egalitarianism, libertarianism, Marxism, communitarianism, and feminism - and discusses the work of the most influential contemporary Anglo-American theorists, including G.A.Cohen, Ronald Dworkin, Carol Gilligan, R.M.Hare, Catherine Mackinnon, Robert Nozick, John Rawls, John Roemer, Michael Sandel, and Charles Taylor. By showing how each of these thinkers can be seen as interpreting the idea of treating people as equals Professor Kymlicka brings out both what they have in common and the differences between them. He demonstrates how viewing different theories in terms of this "egalitarian plateau" can help clarify traditional philosophical disputes over the meaning of such concepts as rights, freedom, the common good, exploitation, and justice. Although he covers some of the most advanced contemporary thinking, Professor Kymlicka writes in easily accessible, non-technical language suitable for readers approaching the area for the first time.
