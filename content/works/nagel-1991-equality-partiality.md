This essay explores the central problem of political theory: reconciling the standpoint of the collectivity with the standpoint of the individual. It begins by arguing that the ethical basis of political theory stems from a division within each individual between the personal and impersonal standpoints. The former represents individual desires, interests, and projects, while the latter represents the claims of the collectivity, producing a powerful demand for universal impartiality and equality. The author argues that the search for a political ideal requires an acceptable integration of these two standpoints, noting that the problem of designing institutions that do justice to the equal importance of all persons without making unacceptable demands on individuals has not been solved. The essay goes on to consider the problem of utopianism, arguing that a political theory is Utopian in the pejorative sense if it describes a form of collective life that humans could not lead through any feasible process of social and mental development. A non-utopian solution requires a proper balance between the ideal and persuasive functions of political theory, demanding both impersonal and personal justification. The author explores the concept of political legitimacy, arguing that its ideal is that the use of state power should be capable of being authorized by each citizen, ultimately requiring unanimous agreement on basic principles and institutions. The essay concludes that a harmonious combination of an acceptable political ideal and acceptable standards of personal morality is difficult to achieve, arguing that the problem of designing institutions that do justice to the equal importance of all persons without making unacceptable demands on individuals remains unsolved. – AI-generated abstract.
