When and why is it all right to kill? When and why is it wrong? Three theories on the ethics of killing are critically examined in the book: deontology, a libertarian moral rights theory, and utilitarianism. The implications of each theory are worked out for different kinds of killing in chapters on murder, capital punishment, suicide, assisted death, abortion, survival lotteries, killing in war, and the killing of animals. With the help of a survey given to 1,000 participants in three very different countries (China, Russia, and the United States), the book focuses on various thought-provoking questions, allowing us to see the aforementioned issues in a new light. Through analysis of the survey’s results, we are able to take note of the role that cultural influence plays in shaping people’s opinions on these matters, and thus can attempt to transcend these same cultural biases. In the final analysis, it is argued that utilitarianisam can best account for, and explain, our considered intuitions about each of these kinds of killing.
