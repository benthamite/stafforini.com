An enormous chronological collection of over fifty interviews conducted with Chomsky from 1968 to 2003. Many of the pieces have never appeared in any other collection, some have never appeared in English, and more than one has been suppressed. This expanded edition contains fifty pages of brand new interviews. The interviews add a personal dimension to the full breadth of Chomsky's written canon-- equally covering his analysis in linguistics, philosophy, and politics. This updated, annotated, fully indexed new edition contains an extensive bibliography, as well as an introduction by editor Carlos Otero on the relationship between Chomsky's language and politics.
