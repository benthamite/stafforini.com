I have been asked to speak to-day on the ‘new philosophy’ which arose and gradually triumphed in the period between the birth of Bruno in 1548 and the death of Descartes in 1650. I propose to put a fairly wide interpretation on the word ‘philosophy’, as did all the great thinkers of our period. And I propose to begin by giving a fairly full, though necessarily very imperfect, synopsis of the old philosophy against which the new doctrines reacted and which they superseded. What I shall describe with the name of the ‘old philosophy’ is the theory of the universe which St Thomas had elaborated on the basis of such knowledge of the works of Aristotle as was available to him.
