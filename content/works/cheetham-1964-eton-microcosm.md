This anthology presents a multifaceted portrait of Eton College, one of Britain's most prestigious public schools, through a collection of historical documents, personal accounts, literary excerpts, and critical commentaries. The work explores Eton's evolution from its founding in 1440 by Henry VI through various historical crises, including the Wars of the Roses, the Reformation, and Civil War, demonstrating the institution's remarkable adaptability. Particular attention is given to the school's distinct traditions, disciplinary systems, and social hierarchies, including the practice of fagging and the role of Pop (the Eton Society). The anthology incorporates diverse perspectives, ranging from nostalgic Old Etonian reminiscences to sharp criticisms of the public school system's role in perpetuating class divisions. Contemporary accounts from students, teachers, and visitors provide insight into daily life at the school, while literary contributions from notable alumni like Shelley and Swinburne offer more personal reflections. The work concludes with a critical examination of Eton's place in modern Britain, weighing arguments for both its preservation and abolition in an increasingly democratic society. - AI-generated abstract
