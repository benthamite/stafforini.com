This article explores the morality of sacrificing one person to save a larger number of people. The author argues that, contrary to common intuition, there is no moral obligation to save more lives if doing so requires sacrificing another person. The author rejects the idea that numbers alone determine the moral value of an action and instead emphasizes the importance of individual lives and the moral weight of each individual's well-being. By examining various thought experiments and contrasting them with different ethical frameworks, the author demonstrates that focusing solely on the overall number of lives saved can lead to morally problematic conclusions. – AI-generated abstract.
