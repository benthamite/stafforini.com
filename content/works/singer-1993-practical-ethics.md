This work is an introduction to applied ethics, covering topics including equality, animal rights, abortion, euthanasia, global poverty, and environmental ethics. It argues that the fundamental principle of equality is the principle of equal consideration of interests. This principle should be extended beyond humans to include all sentient beings. In doing so, the author criticizes the view that human life is inherently sacred and argues that the capacity for suffering and enjoyment are the key factors in determining moral status. The author also defends a utilitarian approach to ethics, arguing that the best way to make moral decisions is to consider the consequences of our actions for all sentient beings, both human and nonhuman. Finally, the author explores the question of whether we have an obligation to act morally, arguing that while we cannot be certain that acting morally will always lead to happiness, doing so is both rational and essential for living a meaningful life. – AI-generated abstract.
