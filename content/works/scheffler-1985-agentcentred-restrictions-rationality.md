This article examines a class of moral theories that include agent-centered restrictions, which are restrictions that it is impermissible to violate even when doing so would minimize the total amount of violations of those restrictions. Although such restrictions are often thought paradoxical and seemingly contrary to rationality as it is commonly conceived, the author explores two approaches to defending these restrictions. One involves showing that they can be made consistent with the standards of maximizing rationality. This could be done, for example, by arguing that the restrictions serve a higher-order maximizing purpose. Alternatively, one might defend these restrictions by arguing that they are licensed by features of comprehensive human rationality beyond the framework of maximizing rationality – AI-generated abstract.
