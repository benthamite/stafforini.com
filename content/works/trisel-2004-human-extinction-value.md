Concerns are raised about the value of human efforts if humanity goes extinct, often in relation to the finitude of human existence, the temporality of creative works, and the limits of personal influence. This paper argues that the claim that our lives would be meaningless and pointless without future generations is greatly exaggerated. The significance of our efforts does not depend on how long humanity or the universe will last. By adopting reasonable standards to judge significance and accepting that our efforts may not have lasting impacts, we can find value and purpose in our lives irrespective of humanity's longevity. – AI-generated abstract.
