It is possible to relativize obligation-statements to specific agents in order to register the dependence of what an agent should do upon the circumstances of the agent in question (the options available to one agent not guaranteed to be the same as those available to any other agent). It is also possible to relativize obligation-statements to specific agents in order to impute the onus of obligation to one rather than another agent in a situation in which several agents are involved. The present paper advertises the distinction between these two kinds of agent-relativization.
