Steven Pinker, renowned for his optimistic view of human progress, explores the nature of rationality in his new book, *Rationality*.  Challenging the notion that humans are inherently irrational, Pinker argues that our cognitive abilities, evident in our scientific achievements and societal advancements, are a testament to our rational potential. This book delves into the tools and methods of rational thinking, including logic, critical thinking, probability, and decision-making, aiming to equip readers with the skills to navigate the complexities of the modern world. By understanding the benchmarks of rationality, Pinker suggests, we can better combat misinformation, conspiracy theories, and the pitfalls of "post-truth" rhetoric, ultimately empowering ourselves to make more informed and responsible choices, both individually and collectively.
