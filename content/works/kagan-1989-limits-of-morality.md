This book examines the nature of morality and offers an argument for consequentialism. The author argues that ordinary morality rests on two fundamental principles: that there are limits on what actions are morally permissible, and that there are limits on what morality can demand of us.  These two principles are shown to be incompatible, and the book challenges them from both sides.  The author first argues that no coherent constraint against harming can be defended, and then goes on to explore the possibilities for defending options (i.e., moral permissions).  The author argues that a successful defense of options must rely on an appeal to the cost of acting morally.  He then considers and rejects various conceptions of this appeal, along with the related notion of due proportion.  Finally, the book presents and evaluates two arguments for the claim that an adequate moral system must incorporate certain subjective elements, that is, elements which reflect the fact that people have a biased point of view.  The book ends by considering the implications of accepting the demands of a morally objective system.  – AI-generated abstract.
