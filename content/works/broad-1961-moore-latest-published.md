The author discusses (1) the distinction between natural and non-natural characteristics, (2) the "autobiographical" analysis of moral indicatives, (3) the interconnections of value and obligation, and (4) ethical egoism and ethical neutralism in regards to G. E Moore's published pronouncements on ethical problems.
