The first volume of *Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences* is reviewed, with contributions from Windelband, Royce, Couturat, Croce, Enriques, and Loskij. Windelband traces the relationship between logic and the special sciences, psychology, and language. He argues that logic must take the results and methods of the sciences but criticize and compare them. Couturat’s article on symbolic logic is deemed disappointing, as it lacks a modern treatment of the doctrine of types and some confusions are detected. Royce offers an account of inductive reasoning, arguing that it cannot depend on principles like the Uniformity of Nature or the Principle of Sufficient Reason.  Enriques discusses the applicability of logic to the changing world, while Loskij argues for realism, suggesting that the relation of subject and predicate is one of ground and consequent. Finally, Croce’s article is criticized for its patronizing tone and inaccurate portrayal of symbolic logic. – AI-generated abstract
