The existence of persons whose happiness is in question is presupposed in calculations of utility; hence that new individuals produced would be happy is no reason by itself for producing them. But their misery, if produced, would be a reason for not producing them. The decision 'not' to produce new people must be made on the assumption of a population which includes them, whereas the decision to produce cannot be made on that assumption, since it will be false if they aren't produced. Hence there can be a duty, on utilitarian theory, to avoid having children, but not to have them, so far as considerations of the welfare of the contemplated new generations are concerned.
