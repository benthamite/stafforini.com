If you think you are not one of the 95\% of us who procrastinates, take Dr. Steel's test. Based on more than a decade of research, and written with humor, humanity, and solid science, this book offers answers to such questions as: Are we biologically hardwired to procrastinate. If so, why? Is there a difference between procrastination and prudence? What tricks do we play on ourselves when we procrastinate at work, school, and home? If visualizing our dreams isn't enough to make them real, then what steps do we need to take? Along the way, Dr. Steel dispels the myths and misunderstandings of motivation and procrastination, replacing them with a clear explanation of why we put off until tomorrow exactly what we should be doing today. He then offers specific techniques we can use to tame the bad habits that adversely affect our health, happiness, and careers.
