The optimization of human happiness constitutes a technical problem solvable through a rigorous "common sense" framework that applies the scientific method to human conduct. Within this framework, right conduct is defined as the selection of alternatives that yield the maximum presumable surplus of pleasure over pain. Achieving this surplus requires a systematic "technology of happiness" organized around three variables: the sentient agent, the environment, and population density. Happiness production is governed by specific psychological laws, notably the law of diminishing returns, which implies that the equitable distribution of wealth and leisure is essential for maximizing aggregate utility. Current competitive industrial systems are fundamentally inefficient because they suffer from "production-madness," prioritizing wealth accumulation over the efficiency of consumption. This results in periodic crises, the dissipation of natural resources, and racial deterioration through the survival of the incompetent.

An alternative social mechanism, "pantocracy," replaces competition with a public monopoly of socialized production. By utilizing the "adaptive principle"—aligning individual self-interest with public utility through conditional compensation for managers and reduced labor hours for workers—this system incentivizes the application of science to industry. Through the socialization of invention and the adjustment of the "indicative ratio" (the balance of production to consumption), society can decouple human existence from involuntary toil. The transition from commercialism to a moral civilization requires treating politics as a branch of technology, ensuring that all social activities are self-supporting and directed toward the husbanding of resources for the total surplus of sentient happiness. – AI-generated abstract.
