Other Minds gathers Nagel's most important critical essays and reviews on the philosophy of mind, ethics, and political philosophy. The pieces here discuss philosophers from Aristotle to Wittgenstein, as well as contemporary legal and political theorists like Robert Nozick and Ronald Dworkin. Also included are essays tracing Nagel's ongoing participation in debates surrounding the mind-body problem - lucid, opinionated responses to Daniel Dennett, John Searle, and others. Running through Other Minds is Nagel's overriding conviction that the most compelling intellectual issues of our day - from the scientific foundations of Freudian theory to the vicissitudes of judicial interpretation - are essentially philosophical problems. Vital, accessible, and controversial, these writings represent the best of one of our leading thinkers.
