Utilitarianism is the view that one should do whatever will bring about the greatest amount of good. It was first clearly propounded in the eighteenth century by the philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1789). Leading figures in its subsequent development were John Stuart Mill (1863) and Henry Sidgwick (1874), both philosophers with a strong interest in economics. Throughout its history, economists have had a strong influence on the development of utilitarian thinking. Recently, work by the economist John Harsanyi (1953, 1955, 1977a) has been particularly influential. Important recent writings include Griffin (1986), the debate contained in Smart and Williams (1973) and the collection in Sen and Williams (1982).
