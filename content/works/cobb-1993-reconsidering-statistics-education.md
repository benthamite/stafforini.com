1 Recent survey data demonstrate an acute need for curricular resources in statistics. The first half of this paper summarizes and compares a dozen current or recent NSF projects, most of which are developing such resources. (As an aid to interested instructors, an appendix gives more detail on the individual projects, along with a list of available files that provide even more detail.) Nearly all these projects involve activities for statistical laboratories, at least implicitly, although the labs are used in a variety of ways: for analysis of archival data sets, for hands-on production of data for analysis, and for simulation-based learning. These three kinds of labs are compared in terms of their complementary sets of advantages. 2 This paper grows out of a small conference which brought together NSF Program Officers, Principal Investigators and Co-PIs of the projects, and a half-dozen other teachers of statistics. The second half of the paper develops four themes from the conference: (1) Questioning standard assumptions, (2) Resistances to change, (3) Total Quality Management, and (4) Educational Assessment. These themes are (a) offered (modestly) as useful guides to thinking about teaching statistics, then (b) exploited (shamelessly) to argue for a scorched-earth assault on our introductory courses.
