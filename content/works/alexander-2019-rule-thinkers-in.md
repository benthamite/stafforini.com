Genius-level intellectual production is characterized by a high volume of novel ideas, a substantial portion of which may be incorrect or seemingly irrational. This pattern is exemplified by historical figures like Isaac Newton (Bible codes, alchemy) and modern thinkers (Steven Pinker on AI), whose willingness to pursue unconventional lines of inquiry results in both profound breakthroughs (e.g., theory of gravity, cell endosymbiosis) and demonstrable failures. The high value of these "black boxes" of ideation lies in the non-fungible capacity for generating genuinely original concepts, which is argued to be a greater bottleneck to progress than the capacity for evaluation or experimentation. Consequently, a policy of "positive selection," wherein thinkers are valued for their successful insights rather than dismissed for their mistakes, is recommended for intellectual exploration. Conversely, the tendency towards "intellectual outrage culture," which prematurely disqualifies thinkers based on egregious or unpopular errors, risks discarding potentially world-changing ideas. While caution is warranted regarding ideas with immediate, untestable, or harmful social consequences, a general shift toward prioritizing idea generation over strict vetting of the messenger is advocated to accelerate discovery. – AI-generated abstract.
