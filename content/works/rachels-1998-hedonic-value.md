This essay presents and defends a theory of hedonic value, arguing that pleasant experiences are intrinsically good and unpleasant experiences are intrinsically bad. The author supports this theory by demonstrating how sentient experience provides evidence for founding ethics, specifically that pain is inherently bad. The theory is further developed by arguing that the normative import of pleasure and unpleasantness derives from their intrinsic nature, not from extrinsic factors. This leads to the conclusion that pleasures and unpleasures have agent-neutral moral significance, implying that one has as much reason to promote another's hedonic well-being as their own. The essay then explores the application of this theory to practical issues, including assessing the hedonic value of states of affairs and addressing ethical challenges posed by Derek Parfitt.
