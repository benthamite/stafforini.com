The author explores Derek Parfit’s "What We Owe to Each Other" (1998) and his idea of contractualism, which endeavors to provide a theory of right and wrong based on the notion of justifiability to each person. The author argues that the contractualist approach to moral reasoning is not compromised if we abandon the individualistic approach and consider that multiple people’s interests can morally outweigh an individual’s interests. In addition, a "close enough" or "disproportionality" approach can be incorporated into contractualism to take into account lesser burdens that might be outweighed by a greater burden. However, the author questions the justification for setting an absolute threshold for lesser burdens, as this may result in perverse consequences and ultimately lead to worse outcomes for all. – AI-generated abstract.
