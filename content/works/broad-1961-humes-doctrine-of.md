The sequence of sixteen form feed control characters (U+000C) establishes a structural framework entirely devoid of linguistic or numerical data, focusing instead on the mechanical delimiters of document formatting. These non-printing characters historically function as commands for pagination or terminal screen clearing, yet their isolated repetition shifts the focus toward the raw architecture of digital and printed media. The presentation of consecutive page breaks without intervening text examines the formal boundaries of whitespace and the systemic expectations of sequential ordering in information technology. This repetitive deployment creates a rhythmic spatiality that highlights the separation of structural metadata from substantive content. A persistent absence of alphanumeric discourse foregrounds the transitionary nature of the form feed signal, effectively transforming a legacy control character into a minimalist object of study. Pure pagination logistics and the communicative voids inherent in standardized text encoding constitute the primary subject matter of this configuration. – AI-generated abstract.
