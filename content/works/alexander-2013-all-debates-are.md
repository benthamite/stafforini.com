The article argues that many debates revolve around the question of what level of personal responsibility or caution is appropriate in a given situation. The author asserts that one reason for this phenomenon is that people often have different life experiences, leading them to perceive the world differently. For example, someone who grew up in a highly critical environment may be inclined towards self-blame, while someone from a supportive environment may be more prone to excuse their own failures. The author concludes that in order to have a productive discussion, it is important to recognize that participants are often coming from different backgrounds and perspectives, and that their views are likely informed by their own unique experiences. – AI-generated abstract.
