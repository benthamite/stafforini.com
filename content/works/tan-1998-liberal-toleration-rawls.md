In "The Law of Peoples," John Rawls argues that certain nonliberal societies are analogous to nonliberal but reasonable comprehensive doctrines and so meet the demands of liberal toleration. I argue that this claim forgives certain important differences between nonliberal societies and nonliberal views within a liberal society. More crucially, I go on to argue that this problem in Rawls's global theory is not due to faulty application of political liberalism to the global context but is symptomatic of a fundamental problem with political liberalism's idea of toleration.
