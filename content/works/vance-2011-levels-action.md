Economic development is facilitated by a higher capacity for institutionalization, which can streamline monitoring of workers; however, this can train workers to be opposed to new actions. Actions can be categorized as Level 1 actions that directly improve the world, or Level 2 actions which facilitate the effectiveness of Level 1 actions. Level 2 actions tend to have a larger impact, as their effects multiply rather than add. Level 1 actions develop understanding and skills and build chains of reliable events, facilitating society’s ability to accomplish complicated tasks. Trying new things helps one avoid hidden barriers and develop the capacity to understand Level 1 actions well enough to make their probability of failure low and construct long chains of Level 1 actions that will work reliably. – AI-generated abstract.
