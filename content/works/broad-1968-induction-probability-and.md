Contained in this volume are broad's three main writings: "the relation between induction and probability," dealing with the logical and extra-logical assumptions involved in inductive reasoning and the relationship of probability thereto; "the principles of problems induction," emphasizing the role of equiprobability, causal premises, loading and stating the principle of limited variety in terms of a theory of generators; and, "the principles of demonstrative induction," which develops a logic of conditions. here broad also gives a formal statement of mill's methods and an elaboration of w e johnson's "figures of induction." the volume also contains broad's important critical reviews of the work of j m keynes, w e johnson, r von mises, and w kneale. in an article on causation broad examines both the regularity and entailment analysis, and in his "reply to my critics," the logic of conditions is developed, and induction and laws of nature are treated. also included is an article by g h von wright which thoroughly summarizes broad's contributions on induction and probability.
