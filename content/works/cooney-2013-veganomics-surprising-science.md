This book analyzes scientific research on vegetarians, exploring demographics, motivations, and behaviors. Vegetarians are more likely to be young, female, educated, and politically liberal. They are also more empathetic, altruistic, and introverted. They have different values than meat-eaters, often prioritizing social justice and environmental concerns. Although most vegetarians are motivated by health or animal welfare concerns, they are more likely to adopt other motives over time. Former vegetarians often cite health concerns as the main reason they returned to eating meat. However, vegetarians are more likely to stick with their dietary choice if they have vegetarian friends and family members, have made the transition gradually, and see vegetarianism as an important part of their identity. Although meat consumption has been dropping in the U.S., the meat industry continues to focus on poultry as a way to reach consumers interested in healthier options. – AI-generated abstract
