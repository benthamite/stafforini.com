When one encounters disagreement about the truth of a factual claim froma trusted advisor who has access to all of ones evidence, should that move one in the direction of the advisors view? Conciliatory views on disagreement say yes, at least a little. Such views are ex- tremely natural, but they can give incoherent advice when the issue under dispute is disagreement itself. So conciliatory views stand re- futed. But despite first appearances, this makes no trouble for partly conciliatory views: views that recommend giving ground in the face of disagreement about many matters, but not about disagreement it- self.
