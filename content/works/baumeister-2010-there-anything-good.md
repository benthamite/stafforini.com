An odd, unseasonal question – Are women better than men, or vice versa? – Can't or wont? Where the real differences are found – The most underappreciated fact about men – Are women more social? – How culture works – Women, men, and culture : the roots of inequality – Expendable beings, disposable lives – Earning manhood, and the male ego – Exploiting men through marriage and sex – What else, what next?
