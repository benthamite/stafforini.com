Problems in Philosophy is a critical introduction to philosophy. The author offers a synoptic view of philosophical inquiry, discussing such topics as reason and truth, consciousness, the self, meaning, free will, the a priori, and knowledge. The emphasis is on the fundamental intractability of these issues, and a theory is proposed as to why the human mind has so much difficulty resolving them.
