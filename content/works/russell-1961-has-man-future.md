Bertrand Russell argues that mankind's continued existence hinges upon the establishment of a world government. He argues that the development of nuclear weapons has made war a truly existential threat, as the only possible outcome of such a conflict would be the near-total annihilation of all involved. Russell contends that the threat of nuclear war cannot be prevented through existing political arrangements. Instead, he believes that a world government is a necessary condition for a stable peace. He presents a reasoned scheme for a world government, detailing its essential features and offering practical steps for its implementation. Finally, he suggests that the transition to a world government necessitates a profound shift in human behavior, requiring a radical transformation of education and a new emphasis on global cooperation. – AI-generated abstract.
