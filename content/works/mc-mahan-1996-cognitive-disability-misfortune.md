The severely cognitively impaired are often regarded as unfortunate or badly off. This article argues that these views are mistaken. It first rejects the view that those with lower levels of well-being are always unfortunate, arguing that this applies only to those whose well-being is below the norm for their species. It then argues that, while the cognitively impaired are worse off than most normal people, their condition is not a misfortune in the relevant sense, because their lives are good relative to the range of well-being that is accessible to them given their native psychological capacities and potentials. The article concludes by arguing that while the cognitively impaired are not owed duties of justice, it is not because they are outside the sphere of morality altogether. Rather, the relation that we bear to them, as members of the same species, gives us reason to give their interests priority over those of comparably endowed animals. – AI-generated abstract
