Written by José Raúl Capablanca at the height of his chess career, this autobiographical work traces his development from a chess prodigy who defeated Cuba's champion at age twelve to one of the strongest players in the world. Through detailed annotations of 35 of his most significant games against top masters like Alekhine, Marshall, and Bernstein, Capablanca reveals his thought processes, strategic considerations, and technical understanding of chess. The work examines his evolving style across different phases - from his early years of raw talent through his emergence as a mature master with a sophisticated positional approach. While the core of the book consists of deeply annotated games, it also includes personal reflections on key matches and tournaments that shaped his career. The concluding section distills practical advice on chess fundamentals and strategy. Beyond its historical value as a first-hand account of a chess legend's rise, the work serves as an instructive manual that can benefit players of all levels through its clear explanations of chess principles and vivid demonstrations of their application in actual games. - AI-generated abstract
