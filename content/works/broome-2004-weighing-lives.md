Weighing Lives tackles the ethical dilemma of valuing life, particularly in contexts where choices involve sacrificing one life for another or prioritizing life over other goods. This book explores the philosophical framework for comparing and weighing lives, drawing on principles of consequentialism, teleology, and the quantitative conception of well-being. It examines the ethical implications of population size and challenges the common intuition that adding people to the population is ethically neutral. By analyzing the nature of betterness, the notion of a life worth living, and the badness of death, the book offers a systematic approach to addressing the complex issues surrounding the value of life.  While grounded in philosophical reasoning, it utilizes precise methods from economic theory, making its conclusions relevant to economists, political theorists, and anyone grappling with the practical question of how to value life.
