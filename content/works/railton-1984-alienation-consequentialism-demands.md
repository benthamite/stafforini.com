Living up to the demands of morality, or adopting a peculiarly moral perspective, may bring with it alienation from one's personal commitments and even from morality itself. This has been held to show that some moral theories are self-defeating. I argue that a proper understanding of the structure of consequentialist theories reveals that they need not be self-defeating in this way. I then advance some general claims about how to conceptualize morality's relation to the self.
