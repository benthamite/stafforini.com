"How to Measure Anything," Third Edition, argues that any aspect of business or life can be measured, debunking the myth that certain things are immeasurable. Author Douglas Hubbard, creator of Applied Information Economics, demonstrates the power of measurement by revealing how to quantify previously unquantifiable aspects such as customer satisfaction, organizational flexibility, technology ROI, and technology risk. This practical guide provides proven methods and real-world case studies to illustrate how to measure even the most difficult or uncertain elements. The book emphasizes the importance of measurement in improving efficiency, productivity, and decision-making across various industries. It also offers insights into risk management, customer satisfaction, and the philosophical underpinnings of probability, making it an invaluable resource for anyone seeking to measure the seemingly immeasurable.
