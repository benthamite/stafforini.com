What is the strongest argument against libertarianism? Occasionally, someone asks that. Until recently, I didn’t think there were any very strong ones. But today I think there is at least one important argument against liberty that is hard to answer. This isn’t exactly an argument “for tyranny” (as my title colorfully puts it — I have to attract clicks, you know) — there’s no interesting argument for having the government send people to concentration camps, or prohibit people from criticizing the government, or prohibit private property, etc. But it’s an argument for a pretty intrusive state. I’m going to explain it here to see if any readers can identify a good response to it.
