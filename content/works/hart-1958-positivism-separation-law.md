Professor Hart defends the Positivist school of jurisprudence from many of the criticisms which have been leveled against its insistence on distinguishing the law that is from the law that ought to be. He first insists that the critics have confused this distinction with other Positivist theories about law which deserved criticism, and then proceeds to consider the merits of the distinction.
