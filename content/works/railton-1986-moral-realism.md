A naturalistic theory of intrinsic value and of moral rightness is outlined and defended. According to this theory, facts and values need not lie on opposite sides of an epistemological or ontological divide. Facts about what is valuable or right may enter into causal explanations of what we believe and do, while at the same time playing appropriate roles in normative assessment.
