This paper discusses the relative importance of equality and priority in ethical reasoning. The author argues that the concept of equality is often mistaken for the concept of priority, which is more fundamental. While the author concedes that both concepts are relevant in moral reasoning, the author contends that focusing on priority, rather than equality, is a more accurate reflection of what is morally important. Specifically, the author contrasts two opposing perspectives on equality: Telic Egalitarianism, which posits that inequality is bad in itself, and Deontic Egalitarianism, which asserts that equality is only a means to an end, such as avoiding injustice. Both views are analyzed in light of the Levelling Down Objection, which argues that the elimination of inequality by lowering everyone’s level of well-being is not morally desirable. The author ultimately argues that prioritizing the well-being of those who are worse off is a more robust moral principle than pursuing equality. – AI-generated abstract.
