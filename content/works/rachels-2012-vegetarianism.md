This article takes up a series of moral problems about industrial farming, which it assesses as a form of cruelty to animals, as well as environmentally destructive, harmful to rural regions, and with serious consequences for human health. It lays out and attempts to document the pertinent facts behind these claims, especially facts about the farming of pigs, cows, chickens, turkeys, and seafood. It attempts to explain why the industrial system has been remarkably successful as a dominant economic force. It argues that we should boycott industrially produced meat and should not kill animals for food even if the means are humane. It eventually concludes that in practice we should all be vegetarians.
