This autobiography chronicles the life of a prominent musical lexicographer and conductor, from his birth in St. Petersburg in 1894 through his later years in California. Growing up in an intellectual Russian-Jewish family, he developed perfect pitch and musical talent early on, studying piano with his aunt Isabelle Vengerova. After the Russian Revolution, he left for Constantinople and Paris, where he worked with conductor Serge Koussevitzky. In 1923, he immigrated to America, working first at the Eastman School of Music and later becoming conductor of various orchestras, including pioneering performances of works by Charles Ives and other modern composers. His career evolved to focus on musical lexicography, becoming editor of major reference works like Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians. The narrative weaves together his personal relationships, professional achievements, and encounters with major musical figures of the 20th century, while providing insight into the musical and cultural life of Russia, Europe, and America. Throughout, he maintained a characteristic wit and self-deprecating humor, even as he achieved recognition for his contributions to musical scholarship and performance. The account concludes with reflections on aging and his continued professional activity into his nineties. - AI-generated abstract
