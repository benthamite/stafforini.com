It was the split-brain cases which drew me into philosophy. Our knowledge of these cases depends on the rcsults of various psychological tests, as described by Donald MacKay.! These tests made use of two facts. We control each of our arms, and see what is in each half of our visual fields, with only one of Ollr hemispheres. When someone's hemispheres have been disconnected, psychologists can thus present to this person two different written questions in the two halves of his visual field, and can receive two different answers written by this person's two hands.
