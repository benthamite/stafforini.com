In these Perrott Lectures, given at Cambridge University in 1959-60, the distinguished philosopher of Cambridge University presses for the scientific acceptance of paranormal phenomena in a volume that deals with the experiments on card-guessing, the occurrence of waking hallucinations, and the phenomena of trance-mediumship, with an epilogue on the possibility of the survival of human personality after bodily death.
