Libertarianism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual liberty as the central requirement of justice. Libertarians argue that people should be free to live their lives as they see fit, so long as they do not violate the rights of others. They believe that government should be limited to protecting individual rights and providing essential public goods. This book provides an introduction to libertarianism, exploring its core principles, historical context, and applications to contemporary issues, such as economic freedom, social justice, and civil rights.  The book also addresses common misconceptions about libertarianism and examines the influence of libertarian ideas in American and global politics. – AI-generated abstract
