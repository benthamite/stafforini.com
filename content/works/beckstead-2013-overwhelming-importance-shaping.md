This dissertation argues that shaping the far future, spanning millions, billions, and trillions of years, is of paramount importance. The central thesis is that we should prioritize actions that optimize the long-term trajectory of humanity's development, considering the potential for existential risks, the impact of our choices on future generations, and the ethical implications of influencing the trajectory of life itself. The dissertation explores key concepts such as existential risk, development trajectories, and the distinction between broad and targeted interventions. It defends methodological assumptions for normative theory, examines empirical and normative assumptions supporting the thesis, and addresses objections based on population ethics and decision-theoretic paradoxes. The author concludes by advocating for a nuanced approach to decision-making, acknowledging the inconsistencies in our current understanding of ethics and advocating for continued exploration of these complex issues.
