Daniel Kahneman has investigated people's judgments of painful episodes. He has shown that episodes containing more pain may be judged less bad than episodes containing less pain, if they end less badly. Sometimes doctors have to cause their patients pain. They may sometimes be able to prolong the pain unnecessarily, but in doing so reduce it at the end. When this is possible, Kahneman's discovery poses a moral problem for them. Should they prolong the pain in this way? If they do, they will cause more pain, but their patients will judge the whole episode less bad. This paper investigates this problem.
