This book provides a detailed interpretation of John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism. The book begins by examining Mill's theory of welfare and his hedonistic account of what makes life worth living. It goes on to discuss Mill's argument for utilitarianism, showing how it relies on a number of assumptions about the nature of morality, welfare and the human mind. The book then explores various interpretations of Mill's view, discussing the relationship between acts and rules, and arguing against the view that Mill is a rule utilitarian. The book also examines two key objections to utilitarianism: the integrity objection and the problem of justice. The book concludes with a discussion of two of Mill's most important works in political philosophy, On Liberty and The Subjection of Women, showing how they are applications of his utilitarian theory.  – AI-generated abstract
