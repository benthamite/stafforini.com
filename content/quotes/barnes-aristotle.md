> Aristotle's genius ranged widely. [...] There are works on logic and on language; on the arts; on ethics and politics and law; on constitutional history and on intellectual history; on psychology and physiology; on natural history—zoology, biology, botany; on chemistry, astronomy, mechanics, mathematics; on the philosophy of science and the nature of motion, space and time; on metaphysics and the theory of knowledge. Choose a field of research, and Aristotle laboured it; pick an area of human endeavour, and Aristotle discoursed upon it. His range is astonishing.
