> A person totally unacquainted with the party would have found some difficulty in following the conversation, and they have used themselves to this sort of language so long that I really believe it never occurs to them that it is not in common use. Can you imagine Mr. Mill saying seriously to me that they were "very desirous Dumont should come and codify for a few weeks at Ford Abbey"? I wanted to find my Husband one day, and Mr. Mill said "I fancy Sir Samuel is gone to vibrate with Mr. Bentham". If you were asked to take a "post prandial vibration", it would scarcely occur to you it was walking up and down the Cloisters after dinner. They vibrate too on the Terrace, but when they go to the Pleasure Grounds it is a *circumgyration*. I cannot tell you half the old expressions that are in common use. Circumbendibus is a favorite one, the "Grandmother Egg sucking principles" another.
