> [A]nalytical Marxists do no think that Marxism possesses a distinctive and valuable *method*. Others believe that is has such a method, which they call ‘dialectical’. But we believe that, although the *word* ‘dialectical’ has not always been used without clear meaning, it has never been used with clear meaning to denote a method rival to the analytical one[.] […] I do not think that the following, to take a recent example, describes such a method: "This is precisely the first meaning we can give to the idea of dialectic: a logic or form of explanation specifically adapted to the determinant intervention of class struggle in the very fabric of history." (Étienne Balibar, *The Philosophy of Marx*, p. 97.) If you read a sentence like that quickly, it can sound pretty good. The remedy is to read it more slowly.
