> Consider how _strange_ is the question posed by someone who wants a justification for altruism about such a basic matter as this. Suppose he and some other people have been admitted to a hospital with severe burns after being rescued from a fire. “I understand how _my_ pain provides _me_ with a reason to take an analgesic,” he says, “and I understand how my groaning neighbor’s pain gives _him_ a reason to take an analgesic; but how does _his_ pain give _me_ any reason to want him to be given an analgesic? How can _his_ pain give _me_ or anyone else looking at it from outside a reason? This question is crazy. As an expression of puzzlement, it has that characteristic philosophical craziness which indicates that something very fundamental has gone wrong. This shows up in the fact that the _answer_ to the question is _obvious_, so obvious that to ask the question is obviously a philosophical act. The answer is that pain is _awful_. The pain of the man groaning in the next bed is just as awful as yours. That’s your reason to want him to have an analgesic.
