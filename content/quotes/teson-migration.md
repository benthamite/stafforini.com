> Almost every argument for immigration controls is flawed. Take, for example, the argument that we need to 'protect out jobs'. Well, why is someone who charges too much for his labour entitled to keep that job and not be out competed? The usual answer is that it is all right to be out competed by a compatriot but not by a foreigner. But this is simply xenophobic ('communitarian' would be a more charitable word)[.]
