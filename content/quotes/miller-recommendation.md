> This book has one recommendation that, if you follow it, could radically improve your life. It's a concrete, actionable recommendation, not something like "Seek harmony through becoming one with Creation." But the recommendation is so shocking, so seemingly absurd, that if I tell you now without giving you sufficient background, you might stop reading.
