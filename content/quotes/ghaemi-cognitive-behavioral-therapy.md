> The most popular psychological theory about depression these days is the _cognitive-behavioral model_, which views depression as distorting our perception of reality, making our thoughts abnormally negative. This model, the basis for cognitive-behavioral therapy, is contradicted by another theory that has a growing amount of clinical evidence behind it: the _depressive realism hypothesis_. This theory argues that depressed people aren't depressed because they distort reality; they're depressed because they see reality more clearly than other people do.
