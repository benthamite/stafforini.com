> Schizophrenia, hypnosis, amnesia, narcosis, and anesthesia suggest that anything as complicated as the human brain, especially if designed with redundancy for good measure and most assuredly if not designed at all but arising out of a continuous process that began before we were reptiles, should be capable of representing more than one "person." In fact, it must occasionally wire in a bit of memory that doesn't belong or signal for a change in the body's hormonal chemistry that makes us, at least momentarily, "somebody else." I am reminded of the tantalizing distinction that someone made when my wife had our first child after two hours on sodium pentathol: It doesn't make it hurt less, it just keeps you from remembering afterward. Strange that the prospect of pain can't scare me once I've seen that, when I become conscious, I won't remember!
