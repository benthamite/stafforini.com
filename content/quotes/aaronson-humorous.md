> *Quantum Computing since Democritus* is a candidate for the weirdest book ever to be published by Cambridge University Press. The strangeness starts with the title, which conspicuously fails to explain what this book is *about*. Is this another textbook on quantum computing—the fashionable field at the intersection of physics, math, and computer science that's been promising the world a new kind of computer for two decades, but has yet to build an actual device that can do anything more impressive than factor 21 into 3 × 7 (with high probability)? If so, then what does *this* book add to the dozens of others that have already mapped out the fundamentals of quantum computing theory? Is the book, instead, a quixotic attempt to connect quantum computing to ancient history? But what does Democritus, the Greek atomist philosopher, really have to do with the book's content, at least half of which would have been new to scientists of the 1970s, let alone of 300 BC? Having now read the book, I confess that I've had my mind blown, my worldview reshaped, by the author's truly brilliant, original perspectives on everything from quantum computing (as promised in the title) to Gödel's and Turing's theorems to the **P** versus **NP** question to the interpretation of quantum mechanics to artificial intelligence to Newcomb's Paradox to the black hole information loss problem. So, if anyone were perusing this book at a bookstore, or with Amazon's "Look Inside" feature, I would *certainly* tell that person to buy a copy immediately. I'd also add that the author is extremely handsome.
