> We're working on our relationships constantly, and our feelings and reflections, but look what's left out of that. What's left out is a deteriorating world. So shy hasn't therapy noticed that? Because psychotherapy is only working on that "inside" soul. By removing the soul from the world and not recognizing that the soul is also in the world, psychotherapy can't do its job anymore. The buildings are sick, the institutions are sick, the baking system's sick, the schools, the streets—the sickness is out there.
