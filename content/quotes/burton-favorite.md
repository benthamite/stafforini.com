> I am not poor, I am not rich; _nihil est, nihil deest_, I have little, I want nothing: all my treasure is in Minerva's tower. Greater preferment as I could never get, so am I not in debt for it, I have a competence (_laus Deo_) from my noble and munificent patrons, though I live still a collegiate student, as Democritus in his garden, and lead a monastic life, _ipse mihi theatrum_, sequestered from those tumults and troubles of the world, _Et tanquam in specula positus_, (as he said) in some high place above you all, like Stoicus Sapiens, _omnia saecula, praeterita presentiaque videns, uno velut intuitu_, I hear and see what is done abroad, how others run, ride, turmoil, and macerate themselves in court and country, far from those wrangling lawsuits, _aulia vanitatem, fori ambitionem, ridere mecum soleo_: I laugh at all, only secure, lest my suit go amiss, my ships perish, corn and cattle miscarry, trade decay, I have no wife nor children good or bad to provide for. A mere spectator of other men's fortunes and adventures, and how they act their parts, which methinks are diversely presented unto me, as from a common theatre or scene.
