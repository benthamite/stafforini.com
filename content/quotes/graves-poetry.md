> Close bound in a familiar bed All night I tossed, rolling my head; Now dawn returns in vain, for still The vulture squats on her warm hill. I am in love as giants are That dote upon the evening star, And this lank bird is come to prove The intractability of love. Yet still, with greedy eye half shut, Rend the raw liver from its gut: Feed, jealousy, do not fly away – If she who fetched you also stay.
