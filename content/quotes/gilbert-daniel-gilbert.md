> Nozick’s “happiness machine” problem is a popular among academics, who generally fail to consider three things. First, who _says_ that no one would want to be hooked up? The world is full of people who want happiness and don’t care one bit about whether it is “well deserved.” Second, those who claim that they would not agree to be hooked up may already be hooked up. After all, the deal is that you forget your previous decision. Third, no one can _really_ answer this question because it requires them to imagine a future state in which they do not know the very thing they are currently contemplating.
