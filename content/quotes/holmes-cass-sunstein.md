> The most ardent antigovernment libertarian tacitly accepts his own dependency on government, even while rhetorically denouncing signs of dependency in others. This double-think is the core of the American libertarian stance. Those who propagate a libertarian philosophy--such as Robert Nozick, Charles Murray, and Richard Epstein--speak fondly of the "minimal state." But describing a political system that is genuinely capable of representing force and fraud as "minimal" is to suggest, against all historical evidence, that such a system is easy to achieve and maintain.
