> To put a situation into a film simply because you yourself can vouch for its authenticity, either because you've experienced it or because you've hear of it, simply isn't good enough. You may feel sure of yourself because you can always say, "This is true, I've seen it." You can argue as much as you like, but the public or critics still won't accept it. So we have to go along with the idea that truth is stranger than fiction.
