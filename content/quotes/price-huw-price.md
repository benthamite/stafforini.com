> Like coastal cities in the third millennium, important areas of human discourse seem threatened by the rise of modem science. The problem isn't new, of course, or wholly unwelcome. The tide of naturalism has been rising since the seventeenth century, and the rise owes more to clarity than to pollution in the intellectual atmosphere.

Some of the key issues in contemporary metaphysics concern the place and fate of such concepts in a naturalistic world view.
