> The libertarian goals—including immediate abolition of invasions of liberty—are "realistic" in the sense that they _could_ be achieved if enough people agreed on them, and that, _if_ achieved, the resulting libertarian system would be viable. The goal of immediate liberty is not unrealistic or "Utopian" because—in contrast to such goals as the "elimination of poverty"—its achievement is entirely dependent on man's will. If, for example, _everyone_ suddenly and immediately agreed on the overriding desirability of liberty, then total liberty _would be_ immediately achieved.
