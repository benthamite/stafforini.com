> Sex is like a diamond forged in a slaughterhouse. Three billion years of unconscious reproduction. Half a billion more stumbling towards animals that weren't just compelled to mate, but were happy to do it--and finally knew that they were happy. Millions of years spent honing that feeling, making it the most perfect thing in the world. And all just because it worked. All just because it churned out more of the same. [...] Anyone can take the diamond. It's there for the asking. But it's not a lure for us. It's not a bribe. We've stolen the prize, we've torn it free. It's ours to do what we like with.
