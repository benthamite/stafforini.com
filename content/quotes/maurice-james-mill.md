> "I think him [/sc/. James Mill] nearly the most wonderful prose-writer in our language." "That do not I," says Morton. "I approve the matter of his treatises exceedingly, but the style seems to me detestable." "Oh!," says Eustace, "I cannot separate matter and style… My reason for delighting in his book is, that it gives such a fixedness and reality to all that was most vaguely brilliant in my speculations—it converts dreams into demonstrations."
