> We are far too apt to think of Mill as a technically philosophical writer, because we cannot help thinking of him as the author of the _Logic_, and to forget that he, no less than Bentham and the other utilitarians, is primarily dominated by the practical interest of the social reformer. He is really far more interested in the question of how, “once the general happiness is recognized as the ethical standard," this ideal is to be practically realized, than in the question of the ethical criterion and its proof.
