> It is usually stated that 20,000 persons attended Beethoven's funeral, and the figure is supported by contemporary accounts. But the population of Vienna at the time of Beethoven's death was about 320,000, and it is hardly likely that one person out of every sixteen, including children, gathered to pay tribute to the dead master. I have therefore replaced 20,000 by the non-committal "hundreds." On the other hand, the famous account of Beethoven's dying during a violent storm has been triumphantly confirmed. I have obtained from the Vienna Bureau of Meteorology an official extract from the weather report for March 26, 1827, stating that a thunderstorm, accompanied by strong winds, raged over the city at 4:00 in the afternoon.
