> Parking may be the best business in the world. I can’t think of a better one. You employ *one* person to simply *sit* there and take in *cash*. You provide no service, no goods, no *nothing*--except expensive *space*! I know all about it, since I’ve got enough lots of my own—which the city has always insisted I provide. So I know why businessmen love to own them. The lots make *lots* of money! But, much as I like to make a buck, I hate them. Today, thank God, you can no longer by law put another street-level parking lot on King Street. But I firmly believe *no* parking lot should be allowed in any downtown area, period! They add nothing to any city but congestion, exhaust fumes, pollution, and smog. Parking is a hugely profitable but ugly business.
