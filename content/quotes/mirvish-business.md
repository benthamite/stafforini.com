> Parking may be the best business in the world. I can’t think of a better one. You employ _one_ person to simply _sit_ there and take in _cash_. You provide no service, no goods, no _nothing_--except expensive _space_! I know all about it, since I’ve got enough lots of my own—which the city has always insisted I provide. So I know why businessmen love to own them. The lots make _lots_ of money! But, much as I like to make a buck, I hate them. Today, thank God, you can no longer by law put another street-level parking lot on King Street. But I firmly believe _no_ parking lot should be allowed in any downtown area, period! They add nothing to any city but congestion, exhaust fumes, pollution, and smog. Parking is a hugely profitable but ugly business.
