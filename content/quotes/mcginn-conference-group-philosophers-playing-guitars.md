> At a conference a group of philosophers were playing guitars and singing folk songs after the formal sessions were over. They asked Kripke to join in and he replied "If anyone else did, that would be the end of it, but if I do, it will be just another Kripke anecdote." (This is what we philosophers call technically a "meta anecdote.")
