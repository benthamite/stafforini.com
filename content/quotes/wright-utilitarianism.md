> It is surprising to see such a warm, mushy idea—brotherly love—grow out of a word as cold and clinical as "utilitarianism." But it shouldn't be. Brotherly love is implicit in the standard formulations of utilitarianism—maximum total happiness, the greatest good for the greatest number. In other words: everyone's happiness counts equally; you are not priviledged, and you shouldn't act as if you are.
