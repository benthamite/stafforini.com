> A boot, stamping on a human face – forever! No! Wait! Sorry! Wrong future for socialism! This is John Roemer’s _A _/Future__ for Socialism/, a book on how to build a kinder, gentler socialist economy. It argues for – and I believe proves – a bold thesis: a socialist economy is entirely compatible with prosperity, innovation, and consumer satisfaction – just as long as by “socialism”, you mean “capitalism”.
