> One way to see the unacceptability of welfare-independent rights is to ask the question 'why Right X?' to a very ultimate level. If the answer is 'Right X because Y', then one should ask 'Why Y?' For example, if the answer to 'why free speech?' is that people enjoy free speech, it is already not welfare-independent. If the answer is free speech deters dictatorship', then we should ask, 'Why is it desirable to deter dictatorship?' If one presses hard enough with such questions, most people will eventually come up with a welfare-related answer.
