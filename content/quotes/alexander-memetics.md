> A blog like this one probably should promote the opinions and advice most likely to be underrepresented in the blog-reading populace (which is *totally different* from the populace at large). But this might convince "thought leaders", who then use it to inspire change in the populace at large, which will probably be in the wrong direction. I think most of my friends are too leftist but society as a whole is too rightist—should I spread leftist or rightist memes among my friends?
