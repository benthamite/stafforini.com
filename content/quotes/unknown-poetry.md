> Sweet day! so cool, so calm, so bright, The bridall of the earth and skie : The dew shall weep thy fall to-night ; For thou must die. Sweet rose, whose hue angrie and brave Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye: Thy root is ever in its grave, And thou must die. Sweet spring! full of sweet days and roses, A box where sweets compacted lie, My musick shows ye have your closes, And all must die. Onely a sweet and vertuous soul, Like season'd timber, never gives ; But though the whole world turn to coal, Then chiefly lives.
