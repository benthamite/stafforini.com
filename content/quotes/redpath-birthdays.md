> There was a charming scene on Broad's eightieth birthday, when he had tea with the Senior Bursar of Trinity, Dr Bradfield, Mrs Bradfield, and their son. There was a superb birthday cake, with eighty lighted candles. Broad was proud of his feat in blowing them all out with a single breath. Commenting on his exploit, Broad writes: 'The practice of emitting hot air, of which philosophy so largely consists, had no doubt been a good training for me.'
