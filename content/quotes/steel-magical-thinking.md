> Benjamin Franklin wrote about the need for hard work in _The Way to Wealth_, over 150 before Wallace Wattles’ _The Science of Getting Rich_, the book that inspired _The Secret_. Even if you adopt the premise that magical thinking works, it is traditionally thought to operate contrary to the way professed by _The Secret_. Magnets actually attract their counter; that is, positive attracts negative. Consequently, boasting about or predicting a positive result means it is less likely to come true; we jinx the outcome by tempting fate. It is why we knock on or touch woof after reporting good luck or health, in an effort to avoid the curse and allow the good luck to continue.
