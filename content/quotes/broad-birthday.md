> I will now say something of what happened to me from and including my 80th birthday up to the end of 1968. I will begin with my 80th birthday. December 30th., 1967 naturally began with showers of congratulatory letters and telegrams, and with some gifts. Among these, I will single out for mention a telegram from Bertrand Russell, a card of good wishes from the Kitchen Staff, and the gift of a beautiful silver penknife from Dr Husband. At 4.20 pm, Bradfield fetched me in his car to his home, where I had tea with him and his wife and his son ("The Nord'). There was a superb cake with 80 candles, all of which I managed to blow out with one breath. (The practice of emitting hot air, of which philosophy so largely consists, had no doubt been a good training for me.)
