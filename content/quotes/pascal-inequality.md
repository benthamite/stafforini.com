> Thus we have, I think, a rather complete refutation of those strange people who think life is nice. In the first place, life is clearly not nice for that substantial proportion of mankind (soon to be a majority) who must live from day to day from hand to mouth for ever on the verge or over the verge of starvation. Ask some of the thousands who starve each day how much they enjoy the beautiful birds and flowers and trees. Ask them their opinion of God's love and His tender mercy. Or if perchance you don't believe in God, then ask them their opinion of the love and tender mercy of their fellow human beings, the rich gods across the sea who couldn't care less about their sufferings -at any rate not enough to go out of their way to help them. Ask them those questions. They count too.
