> Pain is an evil--all our morality implies that. Even if we have a right to forgive the universe our own pain--and I doubt if we have the right to do even this--we have certainly no right to forgive it the pain of others. We must either believe the pain inflicted for some good purpose, or condemn the universe in which it occurs.
