> If you think it would serve utility to ‘withdraw tolerance’ from such-and-such dangerous opinions, you’d better think through _all_ the consequences. Your effort might be an ineffective gesture; in which case, whatever you might accomplish, you will not do away with the danger. Or it might be not so ineffective. To the extent that you succeed in withdrawing toleration from your enemy, to that extent you deprive him of his incentive to tolerate you. If toleration is withdrawn in _all_ directions, are you sure the opinions that enhance utility will be better off? When we no longer renounce the _argumentum ad baculum_, are you sure it will be you that carries the biggest stick?
