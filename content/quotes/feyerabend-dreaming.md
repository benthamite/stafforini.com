> One night […] I dreamed that I had a rather pleasant sensation in my right leg. The sensation increased in intensity, and I began to wake up. It grew even more intense. I woke up more fully and discovered that it had been a severe pain all the time. _The sensation itself told me_ that it had been a sensation of immense pain, which I had mistaken for a sensation of pleasure.
