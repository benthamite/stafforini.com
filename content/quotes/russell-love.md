> Through the long years I sought peace I found ecstasy, I found anguish, I found madness, I found loneliness, I found the solitary pain that gnaws the heart, But peace I did not find. Now, old &amp; near my end, I have known you, And, knowing you, I have found both ecstasy &amp; peace I know rest After so many lonely years. I know what life &amp; love may be. Now, if I sleep I shall sleep fulfilled.
