## SPEC

@SPEC.md

## Important: `content/` is generated — never edit it directly

The `content/` directory contains markdown files generated by ox-hugo export from org source files. These files are committed to git only because Netlify needs them to build the site (it doesn't have Emacs or the org sources). They are build artifacts.

- **Notes** are exported from org files in `~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/websites/pablos-miscellany/`
- **Quotes** are exported from org files in `~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/bibliographic-notes/`
- **Works** are generated by `scripts/generate-work-pages.py` from BibTeX data

To fix content issues, always edit the upstream source (org files or bib files), then re-export. Any direct edits to `content/` will be silently overwritten on the next export.

## Companion Emacs package

The [`stafforini.el`](https://github.com/benthamite/stafforini.el) package provides Emacs commands for driving the build pipeline (exporting notes/quotes, regenerating work pages and backlinks, starting the dev server, etc.). See PUBLISHING.md for the full command reference. The package lives in a separate repo but wraps the scripts in this one.
